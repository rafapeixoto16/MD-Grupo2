For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet. For information on vitamin C and COVID-19, see Dietary Supplements in the Time of COVID-19. Introduction Vitamin C, also known as L-ascorbic acid, is a water-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in some foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement. Humans, unlike most animals, are unable to synthesize vitamin C endogenously, so it is an essential dietary component . Vitamin C is required for the biosynthesis of collagen, L-carnitine, and certain neurotransmitters; vitamin C is also involved in protein metabolism . Collagen is an essential component of connective tissue, which plays a vital role in wound healing. Vitamin C is also an important physiological antioxidant and has been shown to regenerate other antioxidants within the body, including alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) . Ongoing research is examining whether vitamin C, by limiting the damaging effects of free radicals through its antioxidant activity, might help prevent or delay the development of certain cancers, cardiovascular disease, and other diseases in which oxidative stress plays a causal role. In addition to its biosynthetic and antioxidant functions, vitamin C plays an important role in immune function and improves the absorption of nonheme iron , the form of iron present in plant-based foods. Insufficient vitamin C intake causes scurvy, which is characterized by fatigue or lassitude, widespread connective tissue weakness, and capillary fragility [1,2,4,6-9]. The intestinal absorption of vitamin C is regulated by at least one specific dose-dependent, active transporter . Cells accumulate vitamin C via a second specific transport protein. In vitro studies have found that oxidized vitamin C, or dehydroascorbic acid, enters cells via some facilitated glucose transporters and is then reduced internally to ascorbic acid. The physiologic importance of dehydroascorbic acid uptake and its contribution to overall vitamin C economy are unknown. Oral vitamin C produces tissue and plasma concentrations that the body tightly controls. Approximately 70%–90% of vitamin C is absorbed at moderate intakes of 30–180 mg/day. However, at doses above 1 g/day, absorption falls to less than 50% and absorbed, unmetabolized ascorbic acid is excreted in the urine . Results from pharmacokinetic studies indicate that oral doses of 1.25 g/day ascorbic acid produce mean peak plasma vitamin C concentrations of 135 micromol/L, which are about two times higher than those produced by consuming 200–300 mg/day ascorbic acid from vitamin C-rich foods . Pharmacokinetic modeling predicts that even doses as high as 3 g ascorbic acid taken every 4 hours would produce peak plasma concentrations of only 220 micromol/L . The total body content of vitamin C ranges from 300 mg (at near scurvy) to about 2 g . High levels of vitamin C (millimolar concentrations) are maintained in cells and tissues and are highest in leukocytes (white blood cells), eyes, adrenal glands, pituitary gland, and brain. Relatively low levels of vitamin C (micromolar concentrations) are found in extracellular fluids, such as plasma, red blood cells, and saliva . Recommended Intakes Intake recommendations for vitamin C and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academies (formerly National Academy of Sciences) . DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and gender , include the following: Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects Table 1 lists the current RDAs for vitamin C . The RDAs for vitamin C are based on its known physiological and antioxidant functions in white blood cells and are much higher than the amount required for protection from deficiency . For infants from birth to 12 months, the FNB established an AI for vitamin C that is equivalent to the mean intake of vitamin C in healthy, breastfed infants. Table 1: Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for Vitamin C 0–6 months: Male: 40 mg*, Female: 40 mg*, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  7–12 months: Male: 50 mg*, Female: 50 mg*, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  1–3 years: Male: 15 mg, Female: 15 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  4–8 years: Male: 25 mg, Female: 25 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  9–13 years: Male: 45 mg, Female: 45 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  14–18 years: Male: 75 mg, Female: 65 mg, Pregnancy: 80 mg, Lactation: 115 mg 19+ years: Male: 90 mg, Female: 75 mg, Pregnancy: 85 mg, Lactation: 120 mg Smokers: Male: Individuals who smoke require 35 mg/day more vitamin C than nonsmokers. * Adequate Intake (AI) Sources of Vitamin C Food Fruits and vegetables are the best sources of vitamin C (see Table 2) . Citrus fruits, tomatoes and tomato juice, and potatoes are major contributors of vitamin C to the American diet . Other good food sources include red and green peppers, kiwifruit, broccoli, strawberries, Brussels sprouts, and cantaloupe (see Table 2) . Although vitamin C is not naturally present in grains, it is added to some fortified breakfast cereals. The vitamin C content of food may be reduced by prolonged storage and by cooking because ascorbic acid is water soluble and is destroyed by heat . Steaming or microwaving may lessen cooking losses. Fortunately, many of the best food sources of vitamin C, such as fruits and vegetables, are usually consumed raw. Consuming five varied servings of fruits and vegetables a day can provide more than 200 mg of vitamin C.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for vitamin C is 90 mg for adults and children age 4 years and older . FDA does not require food labels to list vitamin C content unless vitamin C has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) FoodData Central lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides a comprehensive list of foods containing vitamin C arranged by nutrient content and by food name. Dietary supplements Supplements typically contain vitamin C in the form of ascorbic acid, which has equivalent bioavailability to that of naturally occurring ascorbic acid in foods, such as orange juice and broccoli [14-16]. Other forms of vitamin C supplements include sodium ascorbate; calcium ascorbate; other mineral ascorbates; ascorbic acid with bioflavonoids; and combination products, such as Ester-C, which contains calcium ascorbate, dehydroascorbate, calcium threonate, xylonate and lyxonate . A few studies in humans have examined whether bioavailability differs among the various forms of vitamin C. In one study, Ester-C and ascorbic acid produced the same vitamin C plasma concentrations, but Ester-C produced significantly higher vitamin C concentrations in leukocytes 24 hours after ingestion . Another study found no differences in plasma vitamin C levels or urinary excretion of vitamin C among three different vitamin C sources: ascorbic acid, Ester-C, and ascorbic acid with bioflavonoids . These findings, coupled with the relatively low cost of ascorbic acid, led the authors to conclude that simple ascorbic acid is the preferred source of supplemental vitamin C . Vitamin C Intakes and Status According to the 2001–2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), mean intakes of vitamin C are 105.2 mg/day for adult males and 83.6 mg/day for adult females, meeting the currently established RDA for most nonsmoking adults . Mean intakes for children and adolescents age 1–18 years range from 75.6 mg/day to 100 mg/day, also meeting the RDA for these age groups . Although the 2001–2002 NHANES analysis did not include data for breastfed infants and toddlers, breastmilk is considered an adequate source of vitamin C . Use of vitamin C-containing supplements is also relatively common, adding to the total vitamin C intake from food and beverages. NHANES data from 1999–2000 indicate that approximately 35% of adults take multivitamin supplements (which typically contain vitamin C) and 12% take a separate vitamin C supplement . According to 1999–2002 NHANES data, approximately 29% of children take some form of dietary supplement that contains vitamin C . Vitamin C status is typically assessed by measuring plasma vitamin C levels . Other measures, such as leukocyte vitamin C concentration, could be more accurate indicators of tissue vitamin C levels, but they are more difficult to assess and the results are not always reliable . Vitamin C Deficiency Acute vitamin C deficiency leads to scurvy . The timeline for the development of scurvy varies, depending on vitamin C body stores, but signs can appear within 1 month of little or no vitamin C intake (below 10 mg/day) . Initial symptoms can include fatigue (probably the result of impaired carnitine biosynthesis), malaise, and inflammation of the gums . As vitamin C deficiency progresses, collagen synthesis becomes impaired and connective tissues become weakened, causing petechiae, ecchymoses, purpura, joint pain, poor wound healing, hyperkeratosis, and corkscrew hairs [1,2,4,6-8]. Additional signs of scurvy include depression as well as swollen, bleeding gums and loosening or loss of teeth due to tissue and capillary fragility . Iron deficiency anemia can also occur due to increased bleeding and decreased nonheme iron absorption secondary to low vitamin C intake . In children, bone disease can be present . Left untreated, scurvy is fatal . Until the end of the 18th century, many sailors who ventured on long ocean voyages, with little or no vitamin C intake, contracted or died from scurvy. During the mid-1700s, Sir James Lind, a British Navy surgeon, conducted experiments and determined that eating citrus fruits or juices could cure scurvy, although scientists did not prove that ascorbic acid was the active component until 1932 [24-26]. Today, vitamin C deficiency and scurvy are rare in developed countries . Overt deficiency symptoms occur only if vitamin C intake falls below approximately 10 mg/day for many weeks [5-8,22,23]. Vitamin C deficiency is uncommon in developed countries but can still occur in people with limited food variety. Groups at Risk of Vitamin C Inadequacy Vitamin C inadequacy can occur with intakes that fall below the RDA but are above the amount required to prevent overt deficiency (approximately 10 mg/day). The following groups are more likely than others to be at risk of obtaining insufficient amounts of vitamin C. Smokers and passive smokers Studies consistently show that smokers have lower plasma and leukocyte vitamin C levels than nonsmokers, due in part to increased oxidative stress . For this reason, the IOM concluded that smokers need 35 mg more vitamin C per day than nonsmokers . Exposure to secondhand smoke also decreases vitamin C levels. Although the IOM was unable to establish a specific vitamin C requirement for nonsmokers who are regularly exposed to secondhand smoke, these individuals should ensure that they meet the RDA for vitamin C . Infants fed evaporated or boiled milk Most infants in developed countries are fed breastmilk and/or infant formula, both of which supply adequate amounts of vitamin C . For many reasons, feeding infants evaporated or boiled cow's milk is not recommended. This practice can cause vitamin C deficiency because cow's milk naturally has very little vitamin C and heat can destroy vitamin C . Individuals with limited food variety Although fruits and vegetables are the best sources of vitamin C, many other foods have small amounts of this nutrient. Thus, through a varied diet, most people should be able to meet the vitamin C RDA or at least obtain enough to prevent scurvy. People who have limited food variety—including some elderly, indigent individuals who prepare their own food; people who abuse alcohol or drugs; food faddists; people with mental illness; and, occasionally, children—might not obtain sufficient vitamin C [4,6-9,11]. People with malabsorption and certain chronic diseases Some medical conditions can reduce the absorption of vitamin C and/or increase the amount needed by the body. People with severe intestinal malabsorption or cachexia and some cancer patients might be at increased risk of vitamin C inadequacy . Low vitamin C concentrations can also occur in patients with end-stage renal disease on chronic hemodialysis . Vitamin C and Health Due to its function as an antioxidant and its role in immune function, vitamin C has been promoted as a means to help prevent and/or treat numerous health conditions. This section focuses on the following four diseases and disorders in which vitamin C might play a role: cancer (including prevention and treatment), cardiovascular disease, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts, and the common cold. Cancer prevention Epidemiologic evidence suggests that higher consumption of fruits and vegetables is associated with lower risk of most types of cancer, perhaps, in part, due to their high vitamin C content . Vitamin C can limit the formation of carcinogens, such as nitrosamines , in vivo; modulate immune response ; and, through its antioxidant function, possibly attenuate oxidative damage that can lead to cancer . Most case-control studies have found an inverse association between dietary vitamin C intake and cancers of the lung, breast, colon or rectum, stomach, oral cavity, larynx or pharynx, and esophagus . Plasma concentrations of vitamin C are also lower in people with cancer than controls . However, evidence from prospective cohort studies is inconsistent, possibly due to varying intakes of vitamin C among studies. In a cohort of 82,234 women age 33–60 years from the Nurses' Health Study, consumption of an average of 205 mg/day of vitamin C from food (highest quintile of intake) compared with an average of 70 mg/day (lowest quintile of intake) was associated with a 63% lower risk of breast cancer among premenopausal women with a family history of breast cancer . Conversely, Kushi and colleagues did not observe a significantly lower risk of breast cancer among postmenopausal women consuming at least 198 mg/day (highest quintile of intake) of vitamin C from food compared with those consuming less than 87 mg/day (lowest quintile of intake) . A review by Carr and Frei concluded that in the majority of prospective cohort studies not reporting a significantly lower cancer risk, most participants had relatively high vitamin C intakes, with intakes higher than 86 mg/day in the lowest quintiles . Studies reporting significantly lower cancer risk found these associations in individuals with vitamin C intakes of at least 80–110 mg/day, a range associated with close to vitamin C tissue saturation . Evidence from most randomized clinical trials suggests that vitamin C supplementation, usually in combination with other micronutrients, does not affect cancer risk. In the Supplémentation en Vitamines et Minéraux Antioxydants (SU.VI.MAX) study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial,13,017 healthy French adults received antioxidant supplementation with 120 mg ascorbic acid, 30 mg vitamin E, 6 mg beta-carotene, 100 mcg selenium, and 20 mg zinc, or placebo . After a median follow-up time of 7.5 years, antioxidant supplementation lowered total cancer incidence in men but not in women. In addition, baseline antioxidant status was related to cancer risk in men but not in women . Supplements of 500 mg/day vitamin C plus 400 International Units (IU) vitamin E every other day for a mean follow-up period of 8 years failed to reduce the risk of prostate or total cancer compared with placebo in middle-aged and older men participating in the Physicians' Health Study II . Similar findings were reported in women participating in the Women's Antioxidant Cardiovascular Study . Compared with placebo, supplementation with vitamin C (500 mg/day) for an average of 9.4 years had no significant effect on total cancer incidence or cancer mortality. In a large intervention trial conducted in Linxian, China, daily supplements of vitamin C (120 mg) plus molybdenum (30 mcg) for 5–6 years did not significantly affect the risk of developing esophageal or gastric cancer . Moreover, during 10 years of follow-up, this supplementation regimen failed to significantly affect total morbidity or mortality from esophageal, gastric, or other cancers . A 2008 review of vitamin C and other antioxidant supplements for the prevention of gastrointestinal cancers found no convincing evidence that vitamin C (or beta-carotene, vitamin A, or vitamin E) prevents gastrointestinal cancers . A similar review by Coulter and colleagues found that vitamin C supplementation, in combination with vitamin E, had no significant effect on death risk due to cancer in healthy individuals . At this time, the evidence is inconsistent on whether dietary vitamin C intake affects cancer risk. Results from most clinical trials suggest that modest vitamin C supplementation alone or with other nutrients offers no benefit in the prevention of cancer. A substantial limitation in interpreting many of these studies is that investigators did not measure vitamin C concentrations before or after supplementation. Plasma and tissue concentrations of vitamin C are tightly controlled in humans. At daily intakes of 100 mg or higher, cells appear to be saturated and at intakes of at least 200 mg, plasma concentrations increase only marginally . If subjects' vitamin C levels were already close to saturation at study entry, supplementation would be expected to have made little or no difference on measured outcomes . Cancer treatment During the 1970s, studies by Cameron, Campbell, and Pauling suggested that high-dose vitamin C has beneficial effects on quality of life and survival time in patients with terminal cancer . However, some subsequent studies—including a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial by Moertel and colleagues at the Mayo Clinic —did not support these findings. In the Moertel study, patients with advanced colorectal cancer who received 10 g/day vitamin C fared no better than those receiving a placebo. The authors of a 2003 review assessing the effects of vitamin C in patients with advanced cancer concluded that vitamin C confers no significant mortality benefit . Emerging research suggests that the route of vitamin C administration (intravenous [IV] vs. oral) could explain the conflicting findings . Most intervention trials, including the one conducted by Moertel and colleagues, used only oral administration, whereas Cameron and colleagues used a combination of oral and IV administration. Oral administration of vitamin C, even of very large doses, can raise plasma vitamin C concentrations to a maximum of only 220 micromol/L, whereas IV administration can produce plasma concentrations as high as 26,000 micromol/L . Concentrations of this magnitude are selectively cytotoxic to tumor cells in vitro . Research in mice suggests that pharmacologic doses of IV vitamin C might show promise in treating otherwise difficult-to-treat tumors . A high concentration of vitamin C may act as a pro-oxidant and generate hydrogen peroxide that has selective toxicity toward cancer cells [49-51]. Based on these findings and a few case reports of patients with advanced cancers who had remarkably long survival times following administration of high-dose IV vitamin C, some researchers support reassessment of the use of high-dose IV vitamin C as a drug to treat cancer . As discussed below, it is uncertain whether supplemental vitamin C and other antioxidants might interact with chemotherapy and/or radiation . Therefore, individuals undergoing these procedures should consult with their oncologist prior to taking vitamin C or other antioxidant supplements, especially in high doses . Cardiovascular disease Evidence from many epidemiological studies suggests that high intakes of fruits and vegetables are associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease . This association might be partly attributable to the antioxidant content of these foods because oxidative damage, including oxidative modification of low-density lipoproteins, is a major cause of cardiovascular disease . In addition to its antioxidant properties, vitamin C has been shown to reduce monocyte adherence to the endothelium, improve endothelium-dependent nitric oxide production and vasodilation, and reduce vascular smooth-muscle-cell apoptosis, which prevents plaque instability in atherosclerosis . Results from prospective studies examining associations between vitamin C intake and cardiovascular disease risk are conflicting . In the Nurses' Health Study, a 16-year prospective study involving 85,118 female nurses, total intake of vitamin C from both dietary and supplemental sources was inversely associated with coronary heart disease risk . However, intake of vitamin C from diet alone showed no significant associations, suggesting that vitamin C supplement users might be at lower risk of coronary heart disease. A much smaller study indicated that postmenopausal women with diabetes who took at least 300 mg/day vitamin C supplements had increased cardiovascular disease mortality . A prospective study in 20,649 British adults found that those in the top quartile of baseline plasma vitamin C concentrations had a 42% lower risk of stroke than those in the bottom quartile . In male physicians participating in the Physicians' Health Study, use of vitamin C supplements for a mean of 5.5 years was not associated with a significant decrease in total cardiovascular disease mortality or coronary heart disease mortality . A pooled analysis of nine prospective studies that included 293,172 subjects free of coronary heart disease at baseline found that people who took ≥700 mg/day of supplemental vitamin C had a 25% lower risk of coronary heart disease incidence than those who took no supplemental vitamin C . The authors of a 2008 meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies, including 14 studies reporting on vitamin C for a median follow-up of 10 years, concluded that dietary, but not supplemental, intake of vitamin C is inversely associated with coronary heart disease risk . Results from most clinical intervention trials have failed to show a beneficial effect of vitamin C supplementation on the primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. In the Women's Antioxidant Cardiovascular Study, a secondary prevention trial involving 8,171 women age 40 years or older with a history of cardiovascular disease, supplementation with 500 mg/day vitamin C for a mean of 9.4 years showed no overall effect on cardiovascular events . Similarly, vitamin C supplementation (500 mg/day) for a mean follow-up of 8 years had no effect on major cardiovascular events in male physicians enrolled in the Physicians' Health Study II . Other clinical trials have generally examined the effects on cardiovascular disease of supplements combining vitamin C with other antioxidants, such as vitamin E and beta-carotene, making it more difficult to isolate the potential contribution of vitamin C. The SU.VI.MAX study examined the effects of a combination of vitamin C (120 mg/day), vitamin E (30 mg/day), beta-carotene (6 mg/day), selenium (100 mcg/day), and zinc (20 mg/day) in 13,017 French adults from the general population . After a median follow-up time of 7.5 years, the combined supplements had no effect on ischemic cardiovascular disease in either men or women. In the Women's Angiographic Vitamin and Estrogen study, involving 423 postmenopausal women with at least one coronary stenosis of 15%–75%, supplements of 500 mg vitamin C plus 400 IU vitamin E twice per day not only provided no cardiovascular benefit, but significantly increased all-cause mortality compared with placebo . The authors of a 2006 meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials concluded that antioxidant supplements (vitamins C and E and beta-carotene or selenium) do not affect the progression of atherosclerosis . Similarly, a systematic review of vitamin C's effects on the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease found that vitamin C did not have favorable effects on cardiovascular disease prevention . Since then, researchers have published follow-up data from the Linxian trial, a population nutrition intervention trial conducted in China . In this trial, daily vitamin C supplements (120 mg) plus molybdenum (30 mcg) for 5–6 years significantly reduced the risk of cerebrovascular deaths by 8% during 10 years of follow-up after the end of the active intervention. Although the Linxian trial data suggest a possible benefit, overall, the findings from most intervention trials do not provide convincing evidence that vitamin C supplements provide protection against cardiovascular disease or reduce its morbidity or mortality. However, as discussed in the cancer prevention section, clinical trial data for vitamin C are limited by the fact that plasma and tissue concentrations of vitamin C are tightly controlled in humans. If subjects' vitamin C levels were already close to saturation at study entry, supplementation would be expected to have made little or no difference on measured outcomes . Age-related macular degeneration and cataracts Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts are two of the leading causes of vision loss in older individuals. Oxidative stress might contribute to the etiology of both conditions. Thus, researchers have hypothesized that vitamin C and other antioxidants play a role in the development and/or treatment of these diseases. A population-based cohort study in the Netherlands found that adults age 55 years or older who had high dietary intakes of vitamin C as well as beta-carotene, zinc, and vitamin E had a reduced risk of AMD . However, most prospective studies do not support these findings . The authors of a 2007 systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies and randomized clinical trials concluded that the current evidence does not support a role for vitamin C and other antioxidants, including antioxidant supplements, in the primary prevention of early AMD . Although research has not shown that antioxidants play a role in AMD development, some evidence suggests that they might help slow AMD progression . The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS), a large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, evaluated the effect of high doses of selected antioxidants (500 mg vitamin C, 400 IU vitamin E, 15 mg beta-carotene, 80 mg zinc, and 2 mg copper) on the development of advanced AMD in 3,597 older individuals with varying degrees of AMD . After an average follow-up period of 6.3 years, participants at high risk of developing advanced AMD (i.e., those with intermediate AMD or those with advanced AMD in one eye) who received the antioxidant supplements had a 28% lower risk of progression to advanced AMD than participants who received a placebo. A follow-up AREDS2 study confirmed the value of this and similar supplement formulations in reducing the progression of AMD over a median follow-up period of 5 years . High dietary intakes of vitamin C and higher plasma ascorbate concentrations have been associated with a lower risk of cataract formation in some studies . In a 5-year prospective cohort study conducted in Japan, higher dietary vitamin C intake was associated with a reduced risk of developing cataracts in a cohort of more than 30,000 adults age 45–64 years . Results from two case-control studies indicate that vitamin C intakes greater than 300 mg/day reduce the risk of cataract formation by 70%–75% . Use of vitamin C supplements, on the other hand, was associated with a 25% higher risk of age-related cataract extraction among a cohort of 24,593 Swedish women age 49–83 years . These findings applied to study participants who took relatively high-dose vitamin C supplements (approximately 1,000 mg/day) and not to those who took multivitamins containing substantially less vitamin C (approximately 60 mg/day). Data from clinical trials are limited. In one study, Chinese adults who took daily supplements of 120 mg vitamin C plus 30 mcg molybdenum for 5 years did not have a significantly lower cataract risk . However, adults age 65–74 years who received 180 mg vitamin C plus 30 mcg molybdenum combined with other nutrients in a multivitamin/mineral supplement had a 43% significantly lower risk of developing nuclear cataracts than those who received a placebo . In the AREDS study, older individuals who received supplements of 500 mg vitamin C, 400 IU vitamin E, and 15 mg beta-carotene for an average of 6.3 years did not have a significantly lower risk of developing cataracts or of cataract progression than those who received a placebo . The AREDS2 study, which also tested formulations containing 500 mg vitamin C, confirmed these findings . Overall, the currently available evidence does not indicate that vitamin C, taken alone or with other antioxidants, affects the risk of developing AMD, although some evidence indicates that the AREDS formulations might slow AMD progression in people at high risk of developing advanced AMD. The common cold In the 1970s Linus Pauling suggested that vitamin C could successfully treat and/or prevent the common cold . Results of subsequent controlled studies have been inconsistent, resulting in confusion and controversy, although public interest in the subject remains high . A 2007 Cochrane Review examined placebo-controlled trials involving the use of at least 200 mg/day vitamin C taken either continuously as a prophylactic treatment or after the onset of cold symptoms . Prophylactic use of vitamin C did not significantly reduce the risk of developing a cold in the general population. However, in trials involving marathon runners, skiers, and soldiers exposed to extreme physical exercise and/or cold environments, prophylactic use of vitamin C in doses ranging from 250 mg/day to 1 g/day reduced cold incidence by 50%. In the general population, use of prophylactic vitamin C modestly reduced cold duration by 8% in adults and 14% in children. When taken after the onset of cold symptoms, vitamin C did not affect cold duration or symptom severity. Overall, the evidence to date suggests that regular intakes of vitamin C at doses of at least 200 mg/day do not reduce the incidence of the common cold in the general population, but such intakes might be helpful in people exposed to extreme physical exercise or cold environments and those with marginal vitamin C status, such as the elderly and chronic smokers [81-83]. The use of vitamin C supplements might shorten the duration of the common cold and ameliorate symptom severity in the general population , possibly due to the antihistamine effect of high-dose vitamin C . However, taking vitamin C after the onset of cold symptoms does not appear to be beneficial . Health Risks from Excessive Vitamin C Vitamin C has low toxicity and is not believed to cause serious adverse effects at high intakes . The most common complaints are diarrhea, nausea, abdominal cramps, and other gastrointestinal disturbances due to the osmotic effect of unabsorbed vitamin C in the gastrointestinal tract . In postmenopausal women with diabetes who participated in the Iowa Women's Health Study, supplemental (but not dietary) vitamin C intake (at least 300 mg/day) was significantly associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease mortality . The mechanism for this effect, if real, is not clear and this finding is from a subgroup of patients in an epidemiological study. No such association has been observed in any other epidemiological study, so the significance of this finding is uncertain. High vitamin C intakes also have the potential to increase urinary oxalate and uric acid excretion, which could contribute to the formation of kidney stones, especially in individuals with renal disorders . However, studies evaluating the effects on urinary oxalate excretion of vitamin C intakes ranging from 30 mg to 10 g/day have had conflicting results, so it is not clear whether vitamin C actually plays a role in the development of kidney stones [8,85-87]. The best evidence that vitamin C contributes to kidney stone formation is in patients with pre-existing hyperoxaluria . Due to the enhancement of nonheme iron absorption by vitamin C, a theoretical concern is that high vitamin C intakes might cause excess iron absorption. In healthy individuals, this does not appear to be a concern . However, in individuals with hereditary hemochromatosis, chronic consumption of high doses of vitamin C could exacerbate iron overload and result in tissue damage . Under certain conditions, vitamin C can act as a pro-oxidant, potentially contributing to oxidative damage . A few studies in vitro have suggested that by acting as a pro-oxidant, supplemental oral vitamin C could cause chromosomal and/or DNA damage and possibly contribute to the development of cancer . However, other studies have not shown increased oxidative damage or increased cancer risk with high intakes of vitamin C . Other reported effects of high intakes of vitamin C include reduced vitamin B12 and copper levels, accelerated metabolism or excretion of ascorbic acid, erosion of dental enamel, and allergic responses . However, at least some of these conclusions were a consequence of assay artifact, and additional studies have not confirmed these observations . The FNB has established ULs for vitamin C that apply to both food and supplement intakes (Table 3) . Long-term intakes of vitamin C above the UL may increase the risk of adverse health effects. The ULs do not apply to individuals receiving vitamin C for medical treatment, but such individuals should be under the care of a physician . Table 3: Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for Vitamin C 0–12 months: Male: Not possible to establish*, Female: Not possible to establish*, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  1–3 years: Male: 400 mg, Female: 400 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  4–8 years: Male: 650 mg, Female: 650 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  9–13 years: Male: 1,200 mg, Female: 1,200 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  14–18 years: Male: 1,800 mg, Female: 1,800 mg, Pregnancy: 1,800 mg, Lactation: 1,800 mg 19+ years: Male: 2,000 mg, Female: 2,000 mg, Pregnancy: 2,000 mg, Lactation: 2,000 mg *Formula and food should be the only sources of vitamin C for infants. Interactions with Medications Vitamin C supplements have the potential to interact with several types of medications. A few examples are provided below. Individuals taking these medications on a regular basis should discuss their vitamin C intakes with their health care providers. Chemotherapy and radiation The safety and efficacy of the use of vitamin C and other antioxidants during cancer treatment is controversial . Some data indicate that antioxidants might protect tumor cells from the action of radiation therapy and chemotherapeutic agents, such as cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, carmustine, busulfan, thiotepa, and doxorubicin . At least some of these data have been criticized because of poor study design . Other data suggest that antioxidants might protect normal tissues from chemotherapy- and radiation-induced damage and/or enhance the effectiveness of conventional cancer treatment . However, due to the physiologically tight control of vitamin C, it is unclear whether oral vitamin C supplements could alter vitamin C concentrations enough to produce the suggested effects. Individuals undergoing chemotherapy or radiation should consult with their oncologist prior to taking vitamin C or other antioxidant supplements, especially in high doses . 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) Vitamin C, in combination with other antioxidants, may attenuate the increase in high-density lipoprotein levels resulting from combination niacin–simvastatin (Zocor) therapy . It is not known whether this interaction occurs with other lipid-altering regimens . Health care providers should monitor lipid levels in individuals taking both statins and antioxidant supplements . Vitamin C and Healthful Diets The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\" For more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that Includes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils.

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet. For information on vitamin D and COVID-19, see Dietary Supplements in the Time of COVID-19. Introduction Vitamin D (also referred to as calciferol) is a fat-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in a few foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement. It is also produced endogenously when ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight strike the skin and trigger vitamin D synthesis. Vitamin D obtained from sun exposure, foods, and supplements is biologically inert and must undergo two hydroxylations in the body for activation. The first hydroxylation, which occurs in the liver, converts vitamin D to 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], also known as calcidiol. The second hydroxylation occurs primarily in the kidney and forms the physiologically active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D], also known as calcitriol . Vitamin D promotes calcium absorption in the gut and maintains adequate serum calcium and phosphate concentrations to enable normal bone mineralization and to prevent hypocalcemic tetany (involuntary contraction of muscles, leading to cramps and spasms). It is also needed for bone growth and bone remodeling by osteoblasts and osteoclasts [1-3]. Without sufficient vitamin D, bones can become thin, brittle, or misshapen. Vitamin D sufficiency prevents rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. Together with calcium, vitamin D also helps protect older adults from osteoporosis. Vitamin D has other roles in the body, including reduction of inflammation as well as modulation of such processes as cell growth, neuromuscular and immune function, and glucose metabolism [1-3]. Many genes encoding proteins that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis are modulated in part by vitamin D. Many tissues have vitamin D receptors, and some convert 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D. In foods and dietary supplements, vitamin D has two main forms, D2 (ergocalciferol) and D3 (cholecalciferol), that differ chemically only in their side-chain structures. Both forms are well absorbed in the small intestine. Absorption occurs by simple passive diffusion and by a mechanism that involves intestinal membrane carrier proteins . The concurrent presence of fat in the gut enhances vitamin D absorption, but some vitamin D is absorbed even without dietary fat. Neither aging nor obesity alters vitamin D absorption from the gut . Serum concentration of 25(OH)D is currently the main indicator of vitamin D status. It reflects vitamin D produced endogenously and that obtained from foods and supplements . In serum, 25(OH)D has a fairly long circulating half-life of 15 days . Serum concentrations of 25(OH)D are reported in both nanomoles per liter (nmol/L) and nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL). One nmol/L is equal to 0.4 ng/mL, and 1 ng/mL is equal to 2.5 nmol/L. Assessing vitamin D status by measuring serum 25(OH)D concentrations is complicated by the considerable variability of the available assays (the two most common ones involve antibodies or chromatography) used by laboratories that conduct the analyses . As a result, a finding can be falsely low or falsely high, depending on the assay used and the laboratory. The international Vitamin D Standardization Program has developed procedures for standardizing the laboratory measurement of 25(OH)D to improve clinical and public health practice [5,7-10]. In contrast to 25(OH)D, circulating 1,25(OH)2D is generally not a good indicator of vitamin D status because it has a short half-life measured in hours, and serum levels are tightly regulated by parathyroid hormone, calcium, and phosphate . Levels of 1,25(OH)2D do not typically decrease until vitamin D deficiency is severe . Serum concentrations of 25(OH)D and health Although 25(OH)D functions as a biomarker of exposure, the extent to which 25(OH)D levels also serve as a biomarker of effect on the body (i.e., relating to health status or outcomes) is not clear . Researchers have not definitively identified serum concentrations of 25(OH)D associated with deficiency (e.g., rickets), adequacy for bone health, and overall health. After reviewing data on vitamin D needs, an expert committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) concluded that people are at risk of vitamin D deficiency at serum 25(OH)D concentrations less than 30 nmol/L (12 ng/mL; see Table 1 for definitions of deficiency and inadequacy) . Some people are potentially at risk of inadequacy at 30 to 50 nmol/L (12–20 ng/mL). Levels of 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) or more are sufficient for most people. The FNB committee also noted that serum concentrations greater than 125 nmol/L (50 ng/mL) can be associated with adverse effects (Table 1). The Endocrine Society has not identified 25(OH)D concentrations associated with vitamin D sufficiency, insufficiency, and deficiency and does not recommend routine testing of 25(OH)D concentrations in healthy individuals . Table 1: Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] Concentrations and Health <30: ng/mL*: <12, Health status: Associated with vitamin D deficiency, which can lead to rickets in infants and children and osteomalacia in adults 30 to <50: ng/mL*: 12 to <20, Health status: Generally considered inadequate for bone and overall health in healthy individuals ≥50: ng/mL*: ≥20, Health status: Generally considered adequate for bone and overall health in healthy individuals >125: ng/mL*: >50, Health status: Linked to potential adverse effects, particularly at >150 nmol/L (>60 ng/mL) Optimal serum concentrations of 25(OH)D for bone and general health have not been established because they are likely to vary by stage of life, by race and ethnicity, and with each physiological measure used . In addition, although 25(OH)D levels rise in response to increased vitamin D intake, the relationship is nonlinear . The amount of increase varies, for example, by baseline serum levels and duration of supplementation. Recommended Intakes Intake recommendations for vitamin D and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by expert committees of NASEM . DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following: Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects An FNB committee established RDAs for vitamin D to indicate daily intakes sufficient to maintain bone health and normal calcium metabolism in healthy people. RDAs for vitamin D are listed in both micrograms (mcg) and International Units (IU); 1 mcg vitamin D is equal to 40 IU (Table 2). Even though sunlight is a major source of vitamin D for some people, the FNB based the vitamin D RDAs on the assumption that people receive minimal sun exposure . For infants, the FNB committee developed AIs based on the amount of vitamin D that maintains serum 25(OH)D levels above 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) and supports bone development. Table 2: Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for Vitamin D 0-12 months*: Male: 10 mcg (400 IU), Female: 10 mcg (400 IU), Pregnancy: , Lactation:  1–13 years: Male: 15 mcg (600 IU), Female: 15 mcg (600 IU), Pregnancy: , Lactation:  14–18 years: Male: 15 mcg (600 IU), Female: 15 mcg (600 IU), Pregnancy: 15 mcg (600 IU), Lactation: 15 mcg (600 IU) 19–50 years: Male: 15 mcg (600 IU), Female: 15 mcg (600 IU), Pregnancy: 15 mcg (600 IU), Lactation: 15 mcg (600 IU) 51–70 years: Male: 15 mcg (600 IU), Female: 15 mcg (600 IU), Pregnancy: , Lactation:  >70 years: Male: 20 mcg (800 IU), Female: 20 mcg (800 IU), Pregnancy: , Lactation:  Many other countries around the world and some professional societies have somewhat different guidelines for vitamin D intakes . These differences are a result of an incomplete understanding of the biology and clinical implications of vitamin D, different purposes for the guidelines (e.g., for public health in a healthy population or for clinical practice), and/or the use in some guidelines of observational studies in addition to randomized clinical trials to establish recommendations . For example, the United Kingdom Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition recommends intakes of 10 mcg (400 IU)/day for individuals age 4 years and older . The Endocrine Society recommends routine vitamin D supplementation for children and teens age 1 to 18 years, people who are pregnant, adults with pre-diabetes, and adults age 75 years and older, but not for healthy adults age 19 to 74 . The Endocrine Society does not recommend specific doses but notes that all individuals should adhere to the RDA. Sources of Vitamin D Food Few foods naturally contain vitamin D. The flesh of fatty fish (such as trout, salmon, tuna, and mackerel) and fish liver oils are among the best sources . An animal’s diet affects the amount of vitamin D in its tissues. Beef liver, egg yolks, and cheese have small amounts of vitamin D, primarily in the form of vitamin D3 and its metabolite 25(OH)D3. Mushrooms provide variable amounts of vitamin D2 . Some mushrooms available on the market have been treated with UV light to increase their levels of vitamin D2. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved UV-treated mushroom powder as a food additive for use as a source of vitamin D2 in food products . Very limited evidence suggests no substantial differences in the bioavailability of vitamin D from various foods . Animal-based foods typically provide some vitamin D in the form of 25(OH)D in addition to vitamin D3. The impact of this form on vitamin D status is an emerging area of research. Studies show that 25(OH)D appears to be approximately five times more potent than the parent vitamin for raising serum 25(OH)D concentrations . One study found that when the 25(OH)D content of beef, pork, chicken, turkey, and eggs is taken into account, the total amount of vitamin D in the food is 2 to 18 times higher than the amount in the parent vitamin alone, depending on the food . Fortified foods provide most of the vitamin D in American diets . For example, almost all of the U.S. milk supply is voluntarily fortified with about 3 mcg/cup (120 IU), usually in the form of vitamin D3 . In Canada, milk must be fortified with 0.88–1.0 mcg/100 mL (35–40 IU), and the required amount for margarine is at least 13.25 mcg/100 g (530 IU). Other dairy products made from milk, such as cheese and ice cream, are not usually fortified in the United States or Canada. Plant milk alternatives (such as beverages made from soy, almond, or oats) are often fortified with similar amounts of vitamin D to those in fortified cow's milk (about 3 mcg [120 IU]/cup); the Nutrition Facts label lists the actual amount . Ready-to-eat breakfast cereals often contain added vitamin D, as do some brands of orange juice, yogurt, margarine, and other food products. The United States mandates the fortification of infant formula with 1–2.5 mcg/100 kcal (40–100 IU) vitamin D; 1–2 mcg/100 kcal (40–80 IU) is the required amount in Canada . A variety of foods and their vitamin D levels per serving are listed in Table 3.

The FDA developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for vitamin D is 20 mcg (800 IU) for adults and children age 4 years and older . The labels must list vitamin D content in mcg per serving and have the option of also listing the amount in IUs in parentheses. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet. ** Vitamin D is in the yolk. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) FoodData Central lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides a comprehensive list of foods containing vitamin D arranged by nutrient content and by food name. However, FoodData Central does not include the amounts of 25(OH)D in foods. Sun exposure Most people in the world meet at least some of their vitamin D needs through exposure to sunlight . Type B UV (UVB) radiation with a wavelength of approximately 290–320 nanometers penetrates uncovered skin and converts cutaneous 7-dehydrocholesterol to previtamin D3, which in turn becomes vitamin D3. Season, time of day, length of day, cloud cover, smog, skin melanin content, and sunscreen are among the factors that affect UV radiation exposure and vitamin D synthesis. Older people and people with dark skin are less able to produce vitamin D from sunlight . UVB radiation does not penetrate glass, so exposure to sunshine indoors through a window does not produce vitamin D . The factors that affect UV radiation exposure, individual responsiveness, and uncertainties about the amount of sun exposure needed to maintain adequate vitamin D levels make it difficult to provide guidelines on how much sun exposure is required for sufficient vitamin D synthesis . Some expert bodies and vitamin D researchers suggest, for example, that approximately 5–30 minutes of sun exposure, particularly between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., either daily or at least twice a week to the face, arms, hands, and legs without sunscreen usually leads to sufficient vitamin D synthesis . Moderate use of commercial tanning beds that emit 2% to 6% UVB radiation is also effective . However, despite the importance of the sun for vitamin D synthesis, limiting skin exposure to sunlight and UV radiation from tanning beds is prudent . UV radiation is a carcinogen, and UV exposure is the most preventable cause of skin cancer. Federal agencies and national organizations advise taking photoprotective measures to reduce the risk of skin cancer, including using sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or higher, whenever people are exposed to the sun . Sunscreens with an SPF of 8 or more appear to block vitamin D-producing UV rays. In practice, however, people usually do not apply sufficient amounts of sunscreen, cover all sun-exposed skin, or reapply sunscreen regularly. Their skin probably synthesizes some vitamin D, even with typically applied sunscreen amounts . Dietary supplements Dietary supplements can contain vitamins D2 or D3. Vitamin D2 is manufactured using UV irradiation of ergosterol in yeast, and vitamin D3 is typically produced with irradiation of 7-dehydrocholesterol from lanolin obtained from the wool of sheep . An animal-free version of vitamin D3 sourced from lichen is also available . People who avoid all animal-sourced products can contact dietary supplement manufacturers to ask about their sourcing and processing techniques. Both vitamins D2 and D3 raise serum 25(OH)D levels, and they seem to have equivalent ability to cure rickets . In addition, most steps in the metabolism and actions of vitamins D2 and D3 are identical. However, most evidence indicates that vitamin D3 increases serum 25(OH)D levels to a greater extent and maintains these higher levels longer than vitamin D2, even though both forms are well absorbed in the gut [33-36]. Some studies have used dietary supplements containing the 25(OH)D3 form of vitamin D. Per equivalent microgram dose, 25(OH)D3 is three to five times as potent as vitamin D3 . However, no 25(OH)D3 dietary supplements appear to be available to consumers on the U.S. market at this time . Vitamin D Intakes and Status Most people in the United States consume less than recommended amounts of vitamin D. An analysis of data from the 2015–2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) found that average daily vitamin D intakes from foods and beverages were 5.1 mcg (204 IU) in men, 4.2 mcg (168 IU) in women, and 4.9 mcg (196 IU) in children age 2–19 years . In fact, 2013–2016 NHANES data showed that 92% of men, more than 97% of women, and 94% of people age 1 year and older ingested less than the EAR of 10 mcg (400 IU) of vitamin D from food and beverages . The analysis of 2015–2016 data also showed that 28% of all individuals age 2 years and older in the United States took a dietary supplement containing vitamin D . In addition, 26% of participants age 2–5 years and 14% of those age 6–11 years took supplements; rates increased with age from 10% of those age 12–19 years to 49% of men and 59% of women age 60 and older. Total vitamin D intakes were three times higher with supplement use than with diet alone; the mean intake from foods and beverages alone for individuals age 2 and older was 4.8 mcg (192 IU) but increased to 19.9 mcg (796 IU) when dietary supplements were included. Some people take very high doses of vitamin D supplements. In 2013–2014, an estimated 3.2% of the U.S. adult population took supplements containing 100 mcg (4,000 IU) or more vitamin D . One might expect a large proportion of the U.S. population to have vitamin D inadequacy on the basis of vitamin D intakes from foods, beverages, and even dietary supplements. However, comparing vitamin D intakes to serum 25(OH)D levels is problematic. One reason is that sun exposure affects vitamin D status, so serum 25(OH)D levels are usually higher than would be predicted on the basis of vitamin D dietary intakes alone . Another reason is that animal foods contain some 25(OH)D. This form of vitamin D is not included in intake surveys and is considerably more potent than vitamins D2 or D3 at raising serum 25(OH)D levels . An analysis of NHANES 2011–2014 data on serum 25(OH)D levels found that most people in the United States age 1 year and older had sufficient vitamin D intakes according to the FNB thresholds . However, 18% were at risk of inadequacy (levels of 30–49 nmol/L [12–19.6 ng/mL]), and 5% were at risk of deficiency (levels below 30 nmol/L [12 ng/mL]). Four percent had levels higher than 125 nmol/L (50 ng/mL). Proportions at risk of deficiency were lowest among children age 1–5 years (0.5%), peaked at 7.6% in adults age 20–39 years, and fell to 2.9% among adults age 60 years and older; patterns were similar for risks of inadequacy. Rates of deficiency varied by race and ethnicity: 17.5% of non-Hispanic Blacks were at risk of vitamin D deficiency, as were 7.6% of non-Hispanic Asians, 5.9% of Hispanics, and 2.1% of non-Hispanic White people. Again, the pattern was similar for the risk of inadequacy. Vitamin D status in the United States remained stable in the decade between 2003–2004 and 2013–2014. Vitamin D Deficiency People can develop vitamin D deficiency when usual intakes are lower over time than recommended levels, exposure to sunlight is limited, the kidneys cannot convert 25(OH)D to its active form, or absorption of vitamin D from the digestive tract is inadequate. Diets low in vitamin D are more common in people who have milk allergy or lactose intolerance and those who consume an ovo-vegetarian or vegan diet . In children, vitamin D deficiency is manifested as rickets, a disease characterized by a failure of bone tissue to become properly mineralized, resulting in soft bones and skeletal deformities . In addition to bone deformities and pain, severe rickets can cause failure to thrive, developmental delay, hypocalcemic seizures, tetanic spasms, cardiomyopathy, and dental abnormalities . Prolonged exclusive breastfeeding without vitamin D supplementation can cause rickets in infants, and, in the United States, rickets is most common among breastfed Black infants and children . In one Minnesota county, the incidence rate of rickets in children younger than 3 years in the decade beginning in 2000 was 24.1 per 100,000 . Rickets occurred mainly in Black children who were breastfed longer, were born with low birthweight, weighed less, and were shorter than other children. The incidence rate of rickets in the infants and children (younger than 7) seen by 2,325 pediatricians throughout Canada was 2.9 per 100,000 in 2002–2004, and almost all patients with rickets had been breastfed . The fortification of milk (a good source of calcium) and other staples, such as breakfast cereals and margarine, with vitamin D beginning in the 1930s along with the use of cod liver oil made rickets rare in the United States . However, the incidence of rickets is increasing globally, even in the United States and Europe, especially among immigrants from African, Middle-Eastern, and Asian countries . Possible explanations for this increase include genetic differences in vitamin D metabolism, dietary preferences, and behaviors that lead to less sun exposure . In adults and adolescents, vitamin D deficiency can lead to osteomalacia, in which existing bone is incompletely or defectively mineralized during the remodeling process, resulting in weak bones . Signs and symptoms of osteomalacia are similar to those of rickets and include bone deformities and pain, hypocalcemic seizures, tetanic spasms, and dental abnormalities . Screening for vitamin D status is becoming a more common part of the routine laboratory bloodwork ordered by primary-care physicians, irrespective of any indications for this practice [6,52-54]. No studies have examined whether such screening for vitamin D deficiency results in improved health outcomes . The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) found insufficient evidence to assess the benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults . It added that no national professional organization recommends population screening for vitamin D deficiency. Groups at Risk of Vitamin D Inadequacy Obtaining sufficient vitamin D from natural (nonfortified) food sources alone is difficult. For many people, consuming vitamin D-fortified foods and exposing themselves to some sunlight are essential for maintaining a healthy vitamin D status. However, some groups might need dietary supplements to meet their vitamin D requirements. The following groups are among those most likely to have inadequate vitamin D status. Breastfed infants Consumption of human milk alone does not ordinarily enable infants to meet vitamin D requirements, because it provides less than 0.6 to 2.0 mcg/L (25 to 78 IU/L) . The vitamin D content of human milk is related to the mother’s vitamin D status; studies suggest that the breastmilk of mothers who take daily supplements containing at least 50 mcg (2,000 IU) vitamin D3 have higher levels of the nutrient . Although UVB exposure can produce vitamin D in infants, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) advises parents to keep infants younger than 6 months out of direct sunlight, dress them in protective clothing and hats, and apply sunscreen on small areas of exposed skin when sun exposure is unavoidable . The AAP recommends 10 mcg (400 IU)/day vitamin D supplements for exclusively and partially breastfed infants starting shortly after birth and lasting until they are weaned and consume at least 1,000 mL/day vitamin D-fortified formula or whole milk . The AAP also recommends 10 mcg (400 IU)/day supplemental vitamin D for all infants who are not breastfed and ingest less than 1,000 mL/day vitamin D-fortified formula or milk. An analysis of NHANES 2009–2016 data found that only 20.5% of breastfed infants and 31.1% of infants who were not breastfed ingested these recommended amounts of supplements . Older adults Older adults are at increased risk of developing vitamin D insufficiency, partly because the skin's ability to synthesize vitamin D declines with age . In addition, older adults are likely to spend more time than younger people indoors, and they might have inadequate dietary intakes of the vitamin . People with limited sun exposure Homebound individuals; people who wear long robes, dresses, or head coverings for religious reasons; and people with occupations that limit sun exposure are among the groups that are unlikely to obtain adequate amounts of vitamin D from sunlight . The use of sunscreen also limits vitamin D synthesis from sunlight. However, because the extent and frequency of sunscreen use are unknown, the role that sunscreen may play in reducing vitamin D synthesis is unclear . People with dark skin Greater amounts of the pigment melanin in the epidermal layer of the skin result in darker skin and reduce the skin’s ability to produce vitamin D from sunlight . Black Americans, for example, typically have lower serum 25(OH)D levels than White Americans. However, whether these lower levels in persons with dark skin have significant health consequences is not clear . Those of African American ancestry, for example, have lower rates of bone fracture and osteoporosis than do Whites (see the section below on bone health and osteoporosis). People with conditions that limit fat absorption Because vitamin D is fat soluble, its absorption depends on the gut’s ability to absorb dietary fat . Fat malabsorption is associated with medical conditions that include some forms of liver disease, cystic fibrosis, celiac disease, Crohn’s disease, and ulcerative colitis . In addition to having an increased risk of vitamin D deficiency, people with these conditions might not eat certain foods, such as dairy products (many of which are fortified with vitamin D), or eat only small amounts of these foods. Individuals who have difficulty absorbing dietary fat might therefore require vitamin D supplementation . People with obesity or who have undergone gastric bypass surgery Individuals with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more have lower serum 25(OH)D levels than individuals without obesity. Obesity does not affect the skin’s capacity to synthesize vitamin D. However, greater amounts of subcutaneous fat sequester more of the vitamin . People with obesity might need greater intakes of vitamin D to achieve 25(OH)D levels similar to those of people with normal weight . Individuals with obesity who have undergone gastric bypass surgery can also become vitamin D deficient. In this procedure, part of the upper small intestine, where vitamin D is absorbed, is bypassed, and vitamin D that is mobilized into the bloodstream from fat stores might not raise 25(OH)D to adequate levels over time . Various expert groups—including the American Association of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery, The Obesity Society, and the British Obesity and Metabolic Surgery Society—have developed guidelines on vitamin D screening, monitoring, and replacement before and after bariatric surgery Vitamin D and Health The FNB committee that established DRIs for vitamin D found that the evidence was inadequate or too contradictory to conclude that the vitamin had any effect on a long list of potential health outcomes (e.g., on resistance to chronic diseases or functional measures), except for measures related to bone health. Similarly, in a review of data from nearly 250 studies published between 2009 and 2013, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality concluded that no relationship could be firmly established between vitamin D and health outcomes other than bone health . However, because research has been conducted on vitamin D and numerous health outcomes, this section focuses on seven diseases, conditions, and interventions in which vitamin D might be involved: bone health and osteoporosis, cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD), depression, multiple sclerosis (MS), type 2 diabetes, and weight loss. Most of the studies described in this section measured serum 25(OH)D levels using various methods that were not standardized by comparing them to the best methods. Use of unstandardized 25(OH)D measures can raise questions about the accuracy of the results and about the validity of conclusions drawn from studies that use such measures and, especially, from meta-analyses that pool data from many studies that use different unstandardized measures . More information about assay standardization is available from the Vitamin D Standardization Program webpage. Bone health and osteoporosis Bone is constantly being remodeled. However, as people age—and particularly in women during menopause—bone breakdown rates overtake rates of bone building. Over time, bone density can decline, and osteoporosis can eventually develop . More than 53 million adults in the United States have or are at risk of developing osteoporosis, which is characterized by low bone mass and structural deterioration of bone tissue that increases bone fragility and the risk of bone fractures . About 2.3 million osteoporotic fractures occurred in the United States in 2015 . Osteoporosis is, in part, a long-term effect of calcium and/or vitamin D insufficiency, in contrast to rickets and osteomalacia, which result from vitamin D deficiency. Osteoporosis is most often associated with inadequate calcium intakes, but insufficient vitamin D intakes contribute to osteoporosis by reducing calcium absorption . Bone health also depends on support from the surrounding muscles to assist with balance and postural sway and thereby reduce the risk of falling. Vitamin D is also needed for the normal development and growth of muscle fibers. In addition, inadequate vitamin D levels can adversely affect muscle strength and lead to muscle weakness and pain (myopathy) . Most trials of the effects of vitamin D supplements on bone health also included calcium supplements, so isolating the effects of each nutrient is difficult. In addition, studies provided different amounts of nutrients and used different dosing schedules. Among postmenopausal women and older men, many clinical trials have shown that supplements of both vitamin D and calcium result in small increases in bone mineral density throughout the skeleton . They also help reduce fracture rates in institutionalized older people. However, the evidence on the impact of vitamin D and calcium supplements on fractures in community-dwelling individuals is inconsistent. The USPSTF evaluated 11 randomized clinical trials of vitamin D and/or calcium supplementation in a total of 51,419 healthy, community-dwelling adults age 50 years and older who did not have osteoporosis, vitamin D deficiency, or prior fractures . It concluded that the current evidence was insufficient to evaluate the benefits and harms of supplementation to prevent fractures. In addition, the USPSTF recommended against supplementation with 10 mcg (400 IU) or less of vitamin D and 1,000 mg or less of calcium to prevent fractures in this population, but it could not determine the balance of benefits and harms from higher doses. The USPSTF also reviewed the seven published studies on the effects of vitamin D supplementation (two of them also included calcium supplementation) on the risk of falls in community-dwelling adults age 65 years or older who did not have osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency. It concluded with moderate certainty that vitamin D supplementation does not reduce the numbers of falls or injuries, such as fractures, resulting from falls . Another recent systematic review also found that vitamin D and calcium supplements had no beneficial effects on fractures, falls, or bone mineral density . In contrast, a meta-analysis of six trials in 49,282 older adults found that daily vitamin D (10 or 20 mcg [400 IU or 800 IU]/day) and calcium (800 or 1,200 mg/day) supplementation for a mean of 5.9 years reduced the risk of any fracture by 6% and of hip fracture by 16% . One systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 randomized, controlled trials published through 2018 of vitamin D supplementation alone (10–20 mcg [400–800 IU]/day or more at least every week or as rarely as once a year) for 9 months to 5 years found that the supplements provided no protection from fractures in 34,243 older adults . More recently, a 2022 ancillary study of the Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial (VITAL; described in the Cancer section below) investigated whether supplemental vitamin D3 (50 mcg [2,000 IU]/day) would lower the risk of fractures in 25,871 generally healthy men age 50 years and older and women age 55 years and older over a median follow-up of 5.3 years . The mean age of all participants was 67.1 years; 50.6% were women and 20.2% were Black. Most participants were vitamin D sufficient; at baseline, only 2.4% had serum 25(OH)D levels less than 30 nmol/L (12 ng/mL), and 12.9% less than 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL). Vitamin D supplementation did not lower the risk of total fractures, hip fractures, or nonvertebral fractures as compared with placebo. No substantial between-group differences in fracture incidence were found by race, ethnic group, BMI, age, baseline 25(OH)D levels, or whether participants took supplemental calcium, were at high fracture risk, or had a history of fragility fractures. Bone mineral density, bone mass, and fracture risk are correlated with serum 25(OH)D levels in White Americans and Mexican Americans, but not in Black Americans . Factors such as adiposity, skin pigmentation, vitamin D binding protein polymorphisms, and genetics contribute to differences in 25(OH)D levels between Black and White Americans. One clinical trial randomized 260 Black women age 60 years and older (mean age 68.2 years) to receive 60 to 120 mcg (2,400 to 4,800 IU) per day vitamin D3 supplementation to maintain serum 25(OH)D levels above 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL) for 3 years . The results showed no association between 25(OH)D levels or vitamin D dose and the risk of falling in the 184 participants who completed the study. In fact, Black Americans might have a greater risk than White Americans of falls and fractures with daily vitamin D intakes of 50 mcg (2,000 IU) or more . Furthermore, the bone health of older Black American women does not appear to benefit from raising serum 25(OH)D levels beyond 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) . Studies examining the effects of supplemental vitamin D on muscle strength and on rate of decline in muscle function have had inconsistent results . One recent clinical trial, for example, randomized 78 frail and near-frail adults age 65 years and older to receive 20 mcg (800 IU) vitamin D3, 10 mcg 25(OH)D, or placebo daily for 6 months. The groups showed no significant differences in measures of muscle strength or performance . Another study randomized 100 community-dwelling men and women age 60 years and older (most were White) with serum 25(OH)D levels of 50 nmol/L (20 ng/ml) or less to 800 IU vitamin D3 or placebo for 1 year . Participants in the treatment group whose serum 25(OH)D level was less than 70 nmol/L (28 ng/ml) after 4 months received an additional 800 IU/day vitamin D3. Despite increasing serum 25(OH)D levels to an average of more than 80 nmol/L (32 ng/ml), vitamin D supplementation did not affect lower-extremity power, strength, or lean mass. All adults should consume recommended amounts of vitamin D and calcium from foods and supplements if needed. Older women and men should consult their health care providers about their needs for both nutrients as part of an overall plan to maintain bone health and to prevent or treat osteoporosis. Cancer Laboratory and animal studies suggest that vitamin D might inhibit carcinogenesis and slow tumor progression by, for example, promoting cell differentiation and inhibiting metastasis. Vitamin D might also have anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, proapoptotic, and antiangiogenic effects . Observational studies and clinical trials provide mixed evidence on whether vitamin D intakes or serum levels affect cancer incidence, progression, or mortality risk. Some observational studies show associations between low serum levels of 25(OH)D and increased risks of cancer incidence and death. In a meta-analysis of 16 prospective cohort studies in a total of 137,567 participants who had 8,345 diagnoses of cancer, 5,755 participants died from cancer . A 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) increase in 25(OH)D levels was associated with an 11% reduction in total cancer incidence rates and, in women but not men, a 24% reduction in cancer mortality rates. A meta-analysis of prospective studies that evaluated the association between serum 25(OH)D levels and cancer incidence (8 studies) or cancer mortality (16 studies) found that cancer risk decreased by 7% and cancer mortality rates decreased by 2% with each 20 nmol/L (8 ng/mL) increase in serum 25(OH)D levels . Importantly, not all observational studies found higher vitamin D status to be beneficial, and the studies varied considerably in study populations, baseline comorbidities, and measurement of vitamin D levels. Clinical trial evidence provides some support for the observational findings. For example, three meta-analyses of clinical trial evidence found that vitamin D supplementation does not affect cancer incidence but does significantly reduce total cancer mortality rates by 12%–13% [90-92]. In the most recent meta-analysis, 10 randomized clinical trials (including the VITAL trial described below) that included 6,537 cancer cases provided 10 to 50 mcg (400 to 2,000 IU) vitamin D3 daily (six trials) or 500 mcg (20,000 IU)/week to 12,500 mcg (500,000 IU)/year boluses of vitamin D3 (four trials) . The study reports included 3–10 years of follow-up data. The vitamin D supplements were associated with serum 25(OH)D levels of 54 to 135 nmol/L (21.6 to 54 ng/mL). Vitamin D supplementation reduced cancer mortality rates by 13%, and most of the benefit occurred with daily supplementation. The VITAL clinical trial that investigated the effects of vitamin D supplementation on the primary prevention of cancer in the general population gave 50 mcg (2,000 IU)/day vitamin D3 supplements with or without 1,000 mg/day marine omega-3 fatty acids or a placebo for a median of 5.3 years . The study included 25,871 men age 50 years and older and women age 55 years and older who had no history of cancer, and most had adequate serum 25(OH)D levels at baseline. Rates of breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer did not differ significantly between the vitamin D and placebo groups. However, normal-weight participants had greater reductions in cancer incidence and mortality rates than those with overweight or obesity. The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) clinical trial randomized 36,282 postmenopausal women to receive 10 mcg (400 IU) vitamin D3 plus 1,000 mg calcium daily or a placebo for a mean of 7 years . Results showed no effect of supplemental vitamin D and calcium on cancer incidence or mortality during the 7-year trial. Similarly, the supplements did not affect cancer incidence over a long-term median follow-up of 22.3 years, but they did reduce cancer mortality by 7% over this period of time . A few studies have examined the effect of vitamin D supplementation on specific cancers. Below are brief descriptions of studies of vitamin D and its association with, or effect on, breast, colorectal, lung, pancreatic, and prostate cancers. Some observational studies support an inverse association between 25(OH)D levels and breast cancer risk and mortality, but others do not [96-99]. In the WHI clinical trial described above, vitamin D3 and calcium supplements did not reduce breast cancer incidence, and 25(OH)D levels at the start of the study were not associated with breast cancer risk . In a subsequent investigation for 4.9 years after the study's end, women who had taken the vitamin D and calcium supplements (many of whom continued to take them) had an 18% lower risk of in situ (noninvasive) breast cancer . However, women with vitamin D intakes higher than 15 mcg (600 IU)/day at the start of the trial and who received the supplements experienced a 28% increased risk of invasive (but not in situ) breast cancer. A large case-control study included 5,706 individuals who developed colorectal cancer and whose 25(OH)D levels were assessed a median of 5.5 years from blood draw to cancer diagnosis and 7,105 matched controls . The results showed an association between 25(OH)D levels lower than 30 nmol/L (12 ng/mL) and a 31% higher colorectal cancer risk. Levels of 75 to less than 87.5 nmol/L (30 to less than 35 ng/mL) and 87.5 to less than 100 nmol/L (35 to less than 40 ng/mL) were associated with a 19% and 27% lower risk, respectively. The association was substantially stronger in women. In the WHI clinical trial described above, vitamin D3 and calcium supplements had no effect on rates of colorectal cancer . In a subsequent investigation for 4.9 years after the study's end, women who had taken the vitamin D and calcium supplements (many of whom continued to take them) still had the same colorectal cancer risk as those who received placebo . Another study included 2,259 healthy individuals age 45 to 75 years who had had one or more serrated polyps (precursor lesions to colorectal cancer) that had been removed . These participants were randomized to take 25 mcg (1,000 IU) vitamin D3, 1,200 mg calcium, both supplements, or a placebo daily for 3–5 years, followed by an additional 3–5 years of observation after participants stopped the treatment. Vitamin D alone did not significantly affect the development of new serrated polyps, but the combination of vitamin D with calcium increased the risk almost fourfold. The VITAL trial found no association between vitamin D supplementation and the risk of colorectal adenomas or serrated polyps . A study of cohorts that included 5,313 participants who developed lung cancer and 5,313 matched controls found no association between serum 25(OH)D levels and risk of subsequent lung cancer, even when the investigators analyzed the data by sex, age, race and ethnicity, and smoking status . One study comparing 738 men who developed pancreatic cancer to 738 matched controls found no relationship between serum 25(OH)D levels and risk of pancreatic cancer . Another study that compared 200 male smokers in Finland with pancreatic cancer to 400 matched controls found that participants in the highest quintile of 25(OH)D levels (more than 65.5 nmol/L [26.2 ng/mL]) had a threefold greater risk of developing pancreatic cancer over 16.7 years than those in the lowest quintile (less than 32 nmol/L [12.8 ng/mL]) . An investigation that pooled data from 10 studies of cancer in 12,205 men and women found that concentrations of 25(OH)D greater than 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL) but less than 100 nmol/L (40 ng/mL) did not reduce the risk of pancreatic cancer. However, the results did show an increased risk of pancreatic cancer with 25(OH)D levels of 100 nmol/L (40 ng/mL) or above . Research to date provides mixed evidence on whether levels of 25(OH)D are associated with the development of prostate cancer. Several studies published in 2014 suggested that high levels of 25(OH)D might increase the risk of prostate cancer. For example, a meta-analysis of 21 studies that included 11,941 men with prostate cancer and 13,870 controls found a 17% higher risk of prostate cancer for participants with higher levels of 25(OH)D . What constituted a higher level varied by study but was typically at least 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL). In a cohort of 4,733 men, of which 1,731 had prostate cancer, those with 25(OH)D levels of 45–70 nmol/L (18–28 ng/mL) had a significantly lower risk of the disease than men with either lower or higher values . This U-shaped association was most pronounced for men with the most aggressive forms of prostate cancer. A case-control analysis of 1,695 cases of prostate cancer and 1,682 controls found no associations between 25(OH)D levels and prostate cancer risk . However, higher serum 25(OH)D levels (at a cut point of 75 nmol/L [30 ng/mL]) were linked to a modestly higher risk of slow-growth prostate cancer and a more substantial lower risk of aggressive disease. Since 2014, however, several published studies and meta-analyses have found no relationship between 25(OH)D levels and prostate cancer risk . For example, an analysis was conducted of 19 prospective studies that provided data on prediagnostic levels of 25(OH)D for 13,462 men who developed prostate cancer and 20,261 control participants . Vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency did not increase the risk of prostate cancer, and higher 25(OH)D concentrations were not associated with a lower risk. Several studies have examined whether levels of 25(OH)D in men with prostate cancer are associated with a lower risk of death from the disease or from any cause. One study included 1,119 men treated for prostate cancer whose plasma 25(OH)D levels were measured 4.9 to 8.6 years after their diagnosis. Among the 198 participants who died (41 deaths were due to prostate cancer), 25(OH)D levels were not associated with risk of death from prostate cancer or any cause . However, a meta-analysis of seven cohort studies that included 7,808 men with prostate cancer found higher 25(OH)D levels to be significantly associated with lower mortality rates from prostate cancer or any other cause . A dose-response analysis found that each 20 nmol/L [8 ng/mL] increase in 25(OH)D was associated with a 9% lower risk of both all-cause and prostate cancer-specific mortality. For men with prostate cancer, whether vitamin D supplementation lengthens cancer-related survival is not clear. A meta-analysis of three randomized controlled trials in 1,273 men with prostate cancer found no significant differences in total mortality rates between those receiving vitamin D supplementation (from 10 mcg [400 IU]/day for 28 days to 45 mcg [1,800 IU] given in three doses total at 2-week intervals) and those receiving a placebo . The USPSTF stated that, due to insufficient evidence, it was unable to assess the balance of benefits and harms of supplemental vitamin D to prevent cancer . Taken together, studies to date do not indicate that vitamin D with or without calcium supplementation reduces the incidence of cancer, but adequate or higher 25(OH)D levels might reduce cancer mortality rates. Further research is needed to determine whether vitamin D inadequacy increases cancer risk, whether greater exposure to the nutrient can prevent cancer, and whether some individuals could have an increased risk of cancer because of their vitamin D status over time. Cardiovascular disease Vitamin D helps regulate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (and thereby blood pressure), vascular cell growth, and inflammatory and fibrotic pathways . Vitamin D deficiency is associated with vascular dysfunction, arterial stiffening, left ventricular hypertrophy, and hyperlipidemia . For these reasons, vitamin D has been linked to heart health and risk of CVD. Observational studies support an association between higher serum 25(OH)D levels and a lower risk of CVD incidence and mortality. For example, a meta-analysis included 34 observational studies that followed 180,667 participants (mean age greater than 50 years) for 1.3 to more than 32 years. The results showed that baseline serum 25(OH)D levels were inversely associated with total number of CVD events (including myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and stroke) and mortality risk . Overall, the risk of CVD events was 10% lower for each 25 nmol/L (10 ng/mL) increase in serum 25(OH)D. Another large observational study that followed 247,574 adults from Denmark for 0–7 years found that levels of 25(OH)D that were low (about 12.5 nmol/L [5 ng/mL]) and high (about 125 nmol/L [50 ng/mL]) were associated with a greater risk of mortality from CVD, stroke, and acute myocardial infarction . Other meta-analyses of prospective studies have found associations between lower vitamin D status measured by serum 25(OH)D levels or vitamin D intakes and an increased risk of ischemic stroke, ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, and early death . In contrast to the observational studies, clinical trials have provided little support for the hypothesis that supplemental vitamin D reduces the risk of CVD or CVD mortality. For example, a 3-year trial in New Zealand randomized 5,110 adults (mean age 65.9 years) to a single dose of 5,000 mcg (200,000 IU) vitamin D3 followed by 2,500 mcg (100,000 IU) each month or a placebo for a median of 3.3 years . Vitamin D supplementation had no effect on the incidence rate of myocardial infarction, angina, heart failure, arrhythmia, arteriosclerosis, stroke, venous thrombosis, or death from CVD. Similarly, the VITAL clinical trial described above found that vitamin D supplements did not significantly decrease rates of heart attacks, strokes, coronary revascularization, or deaths from cardiovascular causes . Moreover, the effects did not vary by baseline serum 25(OH)D levels or whether participants took the trial’s omega-3 supplement in addition to vitamin D. However, another clinical trial designed to investigate bone fracture risk found that 20 mcg (800 IU)/day vitamin D3 (with or without calcium) or a placebo in 5,292 adults age 70 years and older for a median of 6.2 years offered protection from cardiac failure, but not myocardial infarction or stroke . In the WHI clinical trial described above, daily supplementation with 10 mcg (400 IU) vitamin D3 and 1,000 mg calcium did not affect cardiovascular disease risk during the 7-year trial or during a long-term median follow-up of 22.3 years . However, during this long-term follow-up period, women who received the supplements had a 6% higher risk of death from cardiovascular disease than those who received placebo . High serum cholesterol levels and hypertension are two of the main risk factors for CVD. The data on supplemental vitamin D and cholesterol levels are mixed, as shown in one meta-analysis of 41 clinical trials in a total of 3,434 participants (mean age 55 years). The results of this analysis showed that 0.5 mcg (20 IU) to 214 mcg (8,570 IU)/day vitamin D supplementation (mean of 2,795 IU) for 6 weeks to 3 years reduced serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels, but not high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels . Studies of the effects of vitamin D supplements on hypertension have also had mixed findings. In one meta-analysis of 46 clinical trials that included 4,541 participants, vitamin D supplements (typically 40 mcg [1,600 IU]/day or less) for a minimum of 4 weeks had no significant effects on systolic or diastolic blood pressure . In contrast, another meta-analysis of 30 clinical trials in 4,744 participants (mean age 54.5 years) that administered 5 mcg (200 IU) to 300 mcg (12,000 IU)/day vitamin D3 for a mean of 5.6 months showed that more than 20 mcg (800 IU)/day significantly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure in normal-weight participants who had hypertension . However, more than 20 mcg (800 IU)/day vitamin D3, when taken with calcium supplements, significantly increased blood pressure in participants with overweight and obesity. Another meta-analysis of genetic studies in 146,581 participants (primarily adults) found that a low vitamin D status increased blood pressure and hypertension risk in people with genetic variants associated with low endogenous production of 25(OH)D . Overall, clinical trials show that vitamin D supplementation does not reduce CVD risk, even for people with low 25(OH)D status (below 20 nmol/L [12 ng/mL]) at baseline . Depression Vitamin D is involved in various brain processes, and vitamin D receptors are present on neurons and glia in areas of the brain thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of depression . A systematic review and meta-analysis of 14 observational studies that included a total of 31,424 adults (mean age ranging from 27.5 to 77 years) found an association between deficient or low levels of 25(OH)D and depression . Clinical trials, however, do not support these findings. For example, a meta-analysis of nine trials with a total of 4,923 adult participants diagnosed with depression or depressive symptoms found no significant reduction in symptoms after supplementation with vitamin D . The trials administered different amounts of vitamin D (ranging from 10 mcg [400 IU]/day to 1,000 mcg [40,000 IU]/week). They also had different study durations (5 days to 5 years), mean participant ages (range, 22 years to 75 years), and baseline 25(OH)D levels; furthermore, some but not all studies administered concurrent antidepressant medications. Three trials conducted since that meta-analysis also found no effect of vitamin D supplementation on depressive symptoms. One trial included 206 adults (mean age 52 years) who were randomized to take a bolus dose of 2,500 mcg (100,000 IU) vitamin D3 followed by 500 mcg (20,000 IU)/week or a placebo for 4 months . Most participants had minimal or mild depression, had a low mean baseline 25(OH) level of 33.8 nmol/L (13.5 ng/mL), and were not taking antidepressants. The second trial included 155 adults age 60–80 years who had clinically relevant depressive symptoms, no major depressive disorder, and serum 25(OH)D levels less than 50 to 70 nmol/L (20 to 28 ng/mL) depending on the season; in addition, they were not taking antidepressants . Participants were randomized to take either 30 mcg (1,200 IU)/day vitamin D3 or a placebo for 1 year. In the VITAL trial described above, 16,657 men and women 50 years of age and older with no history of depression and 1,696 with an increased risk of recurrent depression (that had not been medically treated for the past 2 years) were randomized to take 50 mcg (2,000 IU)/day vitamin D3 (with or without fish oil) or a placebo for a median of 5.3 years . The groups showed no significant differences in the incidence and recurrent rates of depression, clinically relevant depressive symptoms, or changes in mood scores. Overall, clinical trials did not find that vitamin D supplements helped prevent or treat depressive symptoms or mild depression, especially in middle-age to older adults who were not taking prescription antidepressants. No studies have evaluated whether vitamin D supplements may benefit individuals under medical care for clinical depression who have low or deficient 25(OH)D levels and are taking antidepressant medication. Multiple sclerosis MS is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system that damages the myelin sheath surrounding and protecting nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. This damage hinders or blocks messages between the brain and body, leading to clinical features, such as vision loss, motor weakness, spasticity, ataxia, tremor, sensory loss, and cognitive impairment . Some people with MS eventually lose the ability to write, speak, or walk. The geographical distribution of MS around the world is unequal. Few people near the equator develop the disease, whereas the prevalence is higher further north and south. This uneven distribution has led to speculation that lower vitamin D levels in people who have less sunlight exposure might predispose them to the disease . Many epidemiological and genetic studies have shown an association between MS and low 25(OH)D levels before and after the disease begins . Observational studies suggest that adequate vitamin D levels might reduce the risk of contracting MS and, once MS is present, decrease the risk of relapse and slow the disease's progression . One study, for example, tested 25(OH)D levels in 1,092 women in Finland an average of 9 years before their MS diagnosis and compared their outcomes with those of 2,123 similar women who did not develop MS . More than half the women who developed MS had deficient or insufficient vitamin D levels. Women with 25(OH)D levels of less than 30 nmol/L (12 ng/mL) had a 43% higher MS risk than women with levels of 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) or higher. Among the women with two or more serum 25(OH)D samples taken before diagnosis (which reduced random measurement variation), a 50 nmol/L increase in 25(OH)D was associated with a 41% reduced risk of MS, and 25(OH)D levels less than 30 nmol/L were associated with an MS risk that was twice as high as levels of 50 nmol/L or higher. Two earlier prospective studies of similar design—one in the United States with 444 non-Hispanic White individuals and the other with 576 individuals in northern Sweden —found that levels of 25(OH)D greater than 99.1 nmol/L (39.6 ng/mL) and at least 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL), respectively, were associated with a 61%–62% lower risk of MS. No clinical trials have examined whether vitamin D supplementation can prevent the onset of MS, but several have investigated whether supplemental vitamin D can help manage the disease. A 2018 Cochrane Review analyzed 12 such trials that had a total of 933 participants with MS; the reviewers judged all of these trials to be of low quality . Overall, vitamin D supplementation, when compared with placebo administration, had no effect on relevant clinical outcomes, such as recurrent relapse or worsened disability. Experts have reached no firm consensus on whether vitamin D can help prevent MS given the lack of clinical trial evidence . In addition, studies have not consistently shown that vitamin D supplementation tempers the signs and symptoms of active MS or reduces rates of relapse. Type 2 diabetes Vitamin D plays a role in glucose metabolism. It stimulates insulin secretion via the vitamin D receptor on pancreatic beta cells and reduces peripheral insulin resistance through vitamin D receptors in the muscles and liver . Vitamin D might be involved in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes through its effects on glucose metabolism and insulin signaling as well as its ability to reduce inflammation and improve pancreatic beta-cell function . Observational studies have linked lower serum 25(OH)D levels to an increased risk of diabetes, but their results might have been confounded by the fact that many participants were overweight or had obesity and were therefore more predisposed to developing diabetes and having lower 25(OH)D levels . A review of 71 observational studies in adults with and without type 2 diabetes from 16 countries found a significant inverse relationship between vitamin D status and blood sugar levels in participants who did and did not have diabetes . In contrast to observational studies, clinical trials provide little support for the benefits of vitamin D supplementation for glucose homeostasis. One trial included 65 adult men and women (mean age 32 years) with overweight or obesity who were otherwise healthy, did not have diabetes, and had low serum vitamin D levels (at or below 50 nmol/L [20 ng/mL]) . The investigators randomly assigned participants to receive either a bolus oral dose of 2,500 mcg (100,000 IU) vitamin D3 followed by 100 mcg (4,000 IU)/day or a placebo for 16 weeks. In the 54 participants who completed the study, vitamin D supplementation did not improve insulin sensitivity or insulin secretion in comparison with placebo. One systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated 35 clinical trials that included 43,407 adults with normal glucose tolerance, prediabetes, or type 2 diabetes who received a median of 83 mcg (3,332 IU)/day vitamin D supplements or placebo for a median of 16 weeks . Vitamin D had no significant effects on glucose homeostasis, insulin secretion or resistance, or hemoglobin A1c levels (a measure of average blood sugar levels over the previous 2–3 months), irrespective of the study population, vitamin D dose, or trial quality. Several trials have investigated whether vitamin D supplementation can prevent the transition from prediabetes to diabetes in patients with adequate 25(OH)D levels, and all have had negative results. In a trial in Norway, 511 men and women age 25–80 years (mean age 62 years) with prediabetes received 500 mcg (20,000 IU) vitamin D3 or a placebo each week for 5 years . The results showed no significant differences in rates of progression to type 2 diabetes; in serum glucose, insulin, or hemoglobin A1c levels; or in measures of insulin resistance. At baseline, participants had an adequate mean serum 25(OH)D level of 60 nmol/L (24 ng/mL). The largest trial to date of vitamin D supplements for diabetes prevention randomized 2,423 men and women age 25 years and older (mean age 60 years) with prediabetes and overweight or obesity (mean BMI of 32.1) to 100 mcg (4,000 IU)/day vitamin D3 or placebo for a median of 2.5 years . Most participants (78%) had adequate serum levels of vitamin D at baseline (at least 50 nmol/L [20 ng/mL]). Vitamin D did not significantly prevent the development of diabetes in comparison with placebo. However, a post hoc analysis showed a 62% lower incidence of diabetes among participants with low baseline serum 25(OH)D levels (less than 30 nmol/L [12 ng/mL]) who took the vitamin D supplement than among those who took the placebo . Studies have also assessed the value of vitamin D supplementation for managing diabetes, and they have found that the vitamin offers limited benefits. One meta-analysis of 20 clinical trials compared the effects of 0.5 mcg (20 IU)/day to 1,250 mcg (50,000 IU)/week vitamin D supplementation for 2–6 months with those of placebo on glycemic control in 2,703 adults from around the world who had diabetes . The vitamin D reduced insulin resistance to a small but significant degree, especially in people taking more than 50 mcg (2,000 IU)/day who were vitamin D deficient at baseline, had good glycemic control, did not have obesity, and were of Middle Eastern ethnicity. However, the supplementation had no significant effects on fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c, or fasting insulin levels. Clinical trials to date provide little evidence that vitamin D supplementation helps maintain glucose homeostasis, reduces the risk of progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes, or helps manage the disease, particularly in vitamin D-replete individuals. Weight loss Observational studies indicate that greater body weights are associated with lower vitamin D status, and individuals with obesity frequently have marginal or deficient circulating 25(OH)D levels . However, clinical trials do not support a cause-and-effect relationship between vitamin D and weight loss. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 15 weight-loss intervention studies that used caloric restriction, exercise, or both, but not necessarily vitamin D supplementation or other treatments, found that people who lost weight had significantly greater increases in serum 25(OH)D levels than those who maintained their weight . In another study, 10 mcg (400 IU)/day vitamin D and 1,000 mg/day calcium supplementation slightly, but significantly, reduced weight gain amounts in comparison with placebo in postmenopausal women, especially those with a baseline total calcium intake of less than 1,200 mg/day . However, a meta-analysis of 12 vitamin D supplementation trials (including 5 in which body composition measurements were primary outcomes) found that vitamin D supplements without calorie restriction did not affect body weight or fat mass when the results were compared with those of placebo . Overall, the available research suggests that consuming higher amounts of vitamin D or taking vitamin D supplements does not promote weight loss. Health Risks from Excessive Vitamin D Excess amounts of vitamin D are toxic. Because vitamin D increases calcium absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, vitamin D toxicity results in marked hypercalcemia (total calcium greater than 11.1 mg/dL, beyond the normal range of 8.4 to 10.2 mg/dL), hypercalciuria, and high serum 25(OH)D levels (typically greater than 375 nmol/l [150 ng/mL]) . Hypercalcemia, in turn, can lead to nausea, vomiting, muscle weakness, neuropsychiatric disturbances, pain, loss of appetite, dehydration, polyuria, excessive thirst, and kidney stones. In extreme cases, vitamin D toxicity causes renal failure, calcification of soft tissues throughout the body (including in coronary vessels and heart valves), cardiac arrhythmias, and even death. Vitamin D toxicity has been caused by consumption of dietary supplements that contained excessive vitamin D amounts because of manufacturing errors, that were taken inappropriately or in excessive amounts, or that were incorrectly prescribed by physicians, [158-160]. Experts do not believe that excessive sun exposure results in vitamin D toxicity because thermal activation of previtamin D3 in the skin gives rise to various non-vitamin D forms that limit formation of vitamin D3. Some vitamin D3 is also converted to nonactive forms . However, frequent use of tanning beds, which provide artificial UV radiation, can lead to 25(OH)D levels well above 375–500 nmol/L (150–200 ng/mL) [161-163]. The combination of high intakes of calcium (about 2,100 mg/day from food and supplements) with moderate amounts of vitamin D (about 19 mcg [765 IU]/day from food and supplements) increased the risk of kidney stones by 17% over 7 years among 36,282 postmenopausal women who were randomly assigned to take 1,000 mg/day calcium and 10 mcg (400 IU)/day vitamin D or a placebo . However, other, shorter (from 24 weeks to 5 years) clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation alone or with calcium in adults found greater risks of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria, but not of kidney stones . The FNB established ULs for vitamin D in 2010 (Table 4) . While acknowledging that signs and symptoms of toxicity are unlikely at daily intakes below 250 mcg (10,000 IU), the FNB noted that even vitamin D intakes lower than the ULs might have adverse health effects over time. The FNB recommended avoiding serum 25(OH)D levels above approximately 125–150 nmol/L (50–60 ng/mL), and it found that even lower serum levels (approximately 75–120 nmol/L [30–48 ng/mL]) are associated with increases in rates of all-cause mortality, risk of cancer at some sites (e.g., pancreas), risk of cardiovascular events, and number of falls and fractures among older adults. Table 4: Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for Vitamin D 0–6 months: Male: 25 mcg (1,000 IU), Female: 25 mcg (1,000 IU), Pregnancy: , Lactation:  7–12 months: Male: 38 mcg (1,500 IU), Female: 38 mcg (1,500 IU), Pregnancy: , Lactation:  1–3 years: Male: 63 mcg (2,500 IU), Female: 63 mcg (2,500 IU), Pregnancy: , Lactation:  4–8 years: Male: 75 mcg (3,000 IU), Female: 75 mcg (3,000 IU), Pregnancy: , Lactation:  9–18 years: Male: 100 mcg (4,000 IU), Female: 100 mcg (4,000 IU), Pregnancy: 100 mcg (4,000 IU), Lactation: 100 mcg (4,000 IU) 19+ years: Male: 100 mcg (4,000 IU), Female: 100 mcg (4,000 IU), Pregnancy: 100 mcg (4,000 IU), Lactation: 100 mcg (4,000 IU) Interactions with Medications Vitamin D supplements may interact with several types of medications. A few examples are provided below. Individuals taking these and other medications on a regular basis should discuss their vitamin D intakes and status with their health care providers. Orlistat The weight-loss drug orlistat (Xenical and alli), together with a reduced-fat diet, can reduce the absorption of vitamin D from food and supplements, leading to lower 25(OH)D levels [167-170]. Statins Statin medications reduce cholesterol synthesis. Because endogenous vitamin D is derived from cholesterol, statins may also reduce vitamin D synthesis . In addition, high intakes of vitamin D, especially from supplements, might reduce the potency of atorvastatin (Lipitor), lovastatin (Altoprev and Mevacor), and simvastatin (FloLipid and Zocor), because these statins and vitamin D appear to compete for the same metabolizing enzyme [170-173]. Steroids Corticosteroid medications, such as prednisone (Deltasone, Rayos, and Sterapred), are often prescribed to reduce inflammation. These medications can reduce calcium absorption and impair vitamin D metabolism [174-176]. In the NHANES 2001–2006 survey, 25(OH)D deficiency (less than 25 nmol/L [10 ng/mL]) was more than twice as common among children and adults who reported oral steroid use (11%) than in nonusers (5%) . Thiazide diuretics Thiazide diuretics (e.g., Hygroton, Lozol, and Microzide) decrease urinary calcium excretion. The combination of these diuretics with vitamin D supplements (which increase intestinal calcium absorption) might lead to hypercalcemia, especially among older adults and individuals with compromised renal function or hyperparathyroidism . Vitamin D and Healthful Diets The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\" For more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that Includes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils. Milk, many ready-to-eat cereals, and some brands of yogurt and orange juice are fortified with vitamin D. Cheese naturally contains small amounts of vitamin D. Vitamin D is added to some margarines.

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet. Introduction Vitamin E is found naturally in some foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement. Vitamin E is the collective name for a group of fat-soluble compounds with distinctive antioxidant activities . Naturally occurring vitamin E exists in eight chemical forms (alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocopherol and alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocotrienol) that have varying levels of biological activity . Alpha- (or α-) tocopherol is the only form that is recognized to meet human requirements. Serum concentrations of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) depend on the liver, which takes up the nutrient after the various forms are absorbed from the small intestine. The liver preferentially resecretes only alpha-tocopherol via the hepatic alpha-tocopherol transfer protein ; the liver metabolizes and excretes the other vitamin E forms . As a result, blood and cellular concentrations of other forms of vitamin E are lower than those of alpha-tocopherol and have been the subjects of less research . Antioxidants protect cells from the damaging effects of free radicals, which are molecules that contain an unshared electron. Free radicals damage cells and might contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease and cancer . Unshared electrons are highly energetic and react rapidly with oxygen to form reactive oxygen species (ROS). The body forms ROS endogenously when it converts food to energy, and antioxidants might protect cells from the damaging effects of ROS. The body is also exposed to free radicals from environmental exposures, such as cigarette smoke, air pollution, and ultraviolet radiation from the sun. ROS are part of signaling mechanisms among cells. Vitamin E is a fat-soluble antioxidant that stops the production of ROS formed when fat undergoes oxidation. Scientists are investigating whether, by limiting free-radical production and possibly through other mechanisms, vitamin E might help prevent or delay the chronic diseases associated with free radicals. In addition to its activities as an antioxidant, vitamin E is involved in immune function and, as shown primarily by in vitro studies of cells, cell signaling, regulation of gene expression, and other metabolic processes . Alpha-tocopherol inhibits the activity of protein kinase C, an enzyme involved in cell proliferation and differentiation in smooth muscle cells, platelets, and monocytes . Vitamin-E-replete endothelial cells lining the interior surface of blood vessels are better able to resist blood cell components adhering to this surface. Vitamin E also increases the expression of two enzymes that suppress arachidonic acid metabolism, thereby increasing the release of prostacyclin from the endothelium, which, in turn, dilates blood vessels and inhibits platelet aggregation . Recommended Intakes Intake recommendations for vitamin E and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the Institute of Medicine of The National Academies (formerly National Academy of Sciences) . DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used to plan and assess nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and gender, include the following: Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects The FNB's vitamin E recommendations are for alpha-tocopherol alone, the only form maintained in plasma. The FNB based these recommendations primarily on serum levels of the nutrient that provide adequate protection in a test measuring the survival of erythrocytes when exposed to hydrogen peroxide, a free radical . Acknowledging great uncertainties in these data, the FNB has called for research to identify other biomarkers for assessing vitamin E requirements. Naturally sourced vitamin E is called RRR-alpha-tocopherol (commonly labeled as d-alpha-tocopherol); the synthetically produced form is all rac-alpha-tocopherol (commonly labeled as dl-alpha-tocopherol). RDAs for vitamin E are provided in milligrams (mg) and are listed in Table 1. One mg vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) is equivalent to 1 mg RRR-alpha-tocopherol or 2 mg all rac-alpha-tocopherol. Because insufficient data are available to develop RDAs for infants, AIs were developed based on the amount of vitamin E consumed by healthy breastfed babies. Table 1: Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for Vitamin E (Alpha-Tocopherol) 0–6 months*: Males: 4 mg, Females: 4 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  7–12 months*: Males: 5 mg, Females: 5 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  1–3 years: Males: 6 mg, Females: 6 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  4–8 years: Males: 7 mg, Females: 7 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  9–13 years: Males: 11 mg, Females: 11 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  14+ years: Males: 15 mg, Females: 15 mg, Pregnancy: 15 mg, Lactation: 19 mg *Adequate Intake (AI) International Units and Milligrams Vitamin E is listed on the new Nutrition Facts and Supplement Facts labels in mg . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required manufacturers to use these new labels starting in January 2020, but companies with annual sales of less than $10 million were allowed to use the old labels that list vitamin E in International Units (IUs) until January 2021 . Conversion rules are as follows: To convert from mg to IU: 1 mg of alpha-tocopherol is equivalent to 1.49 IU of the natural form or 2.22 IU of the synthetic form. To convert from IU to mg: 1 IU of the natural form is equivalent to 0.67 mg of alpha-tocopherol. ​​​​​​​1 IU of the synthetic form is equivalent to 0.45 mg of alpha-tocopherol. To convert from mg to IU: 1 mg of alpha-tocopherol is equivalent to 1.49 IU of the natural form or 2.22 IU of the synthetic form. 1 mg of alpha-tocopherol is equivalent to 1.49 IU of the natural form or 2.22 IU of the synthetic form. 1 mg of alpha-tocopherol is equivalent to 1.49 IU of the natural form or 2.22 IU of the synthetic form. To convert from IU to mg: 1 IU of the natural form is equivalent to 0.67 mg of alpha-tocopherol. ​​​​​​​1 IU of the synthetic form is equivalent to 0.45 mg of alpha-tocopherol. 1 IU of the natural form is equivalent to 0.67 mg of alpha-tocopherol. ​​​​​​​1 IU of the synthetic form is equivalent to 0.45 mg of alpha-tocopherol. 1 IU of the natural form is equivalent to 0.67 mg of alpha-tocopherol. ​​​​​​​1 IU of the synthetic form is equivalent to 0.45 mg of alpha-tocopherol. For example, 15 mg of natural alpha-tocopherol would equal 22.4 IU (15 mg x 1.49 IU/mg = 22.4 IU). The corresponding value for synthetic alpha-tocopherol would be 33.3 IU (15 mg x 2.22 IU/mg). Sources of Vitamin E Food Numerous foods provide vitamin E. Nuts, seeds, and vegetable oils are among the best sources of alpha-tocopherol, and significant amounts are available in green leafy vegetables and fortified cereals (see Table 2 for a more detailed list) . Most vitamin E in American diets is in the form of gamma-tocopherol from soybean, canola, corn, and other vegetable oils and food products . Table 2: Vitamin E (Alpha-Tocopherol) Content of Selected Foods Wheat germ oil, 1 tablespoon: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 20.3, Percent DV*: 135 Sunflower seeds, dry roasted, 1 ounce: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 7.4, Percent DV*: 49 Almonds, dry roasted, 1 ounce: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 6.8, Percent DV*: 45 Sunflower oil, 1 tablespoon: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 5.6, Percent DV*: 37 Safflower oil, 1 tablespoon: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 4.6, Percent DV*: 31 Hazelnuts, dry roasted, 1 ounce: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 4.3, Percent DV*: 29 Peanut butter, 2 tablespoons: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 2.9, Percent DV*: 19 Peanuts, dry roasted, 1 ounce: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 2.2, Percent DV*: 15 Corn oil, 1 tablespoon: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 1.9, Percent DV*: 13 Spinach, boiled, ½ cup: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 1.9, Percent DV*: 13 Broccoli, chopped, boiled, ½ cup: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 1.2, Percent DV*: 8 Soybean oil, 1 tablespoon: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 1.1, Percent DV*: 7 Kiwifruit, 1 medium: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 1.1, Percent DV*: 7 Mango, sliced, ½ cup: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 0.7, Percent DV*: 5 Tomato, raw, 1 medium: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 0.7, Percent DV*: 5 Spinach, raw, 1 cup: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 0.6, Percent DV*: 4 *DV = Daily Value. FDA developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for vitamin E is 15 mg for adults and children age 4 years and older . One mg vitamin E = 1 mg RRR-alpha-tocopherol = 2 mg all rac-alpha-tocopherol. FDA does not require food labels to list vitamin E content unless vitamin E has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) FoodData Central website lists the nutrient content of many foods, including, in some cases, the amounts of alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocopherol. The USDA also provides a comprehensive list of foods containing vitamin E arranged by nutrient content and by food name. Dietary supplements Supplements of vitamin E typically provide only alpha-tocopherol, although mixed products containing other tocopherols and even tocotrienols are available. Naturally occurring alpha-tocopherol exists in one stereoisomeric form. In contrast, synthetically produced alpha-tocopherol contains equal amounts of its eight possible stereoisomers; serum and tissues maintain only four of these stereoisomers . A given amount of synthetic alpha-tocopherol (all rac-alpha-tocopherol; commonly labeled as DL or dl) is therefore only half as active as the same amount (by weight in mg) of the natural form (RRR-alpha-tocopherol; commonly labeled as D or d). Most vitamin-E-only supplements provide ≥67 mg (100 IU of natural vitamin E) of the nutrient. These amounts are substantially higher than the RDAs. Alpha-tocopherol in dietary supplements and fortified foods is often esterified to prolong its shelf life while protecting its antioxidant properties. The body hydrolyzes and absorbs these esters (alpha-tocopheryl acetate and succinate) as efficiently as alpha-tocopherol . Vitamin E Intakes and Status Three national surveys—the 2001–2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) , NHANES III (1988–1994) , and the Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (1994–1996) —have found that the diets of most Americans provide less than the RDA levels of vitamin E. These intake estimates might be low, however, because the amounts and types of fat added during cooking are often unknown and not accounted for . The FNB suggests that mean intakes of vitamin E among healthy adults are probably higher than the RDA but cautions that low-fat diets might provide insufficient amounts unless people make their food choices carefully by, for example, increasing their intakes of nuts, seeds, fruits, and vegetables . The 1999–2000 NHANES found that 11.3% of adults took vitamin E supplements containing at least 400 IU . Vitamin E Deficiency Frank vitamin E deficiency is rare and overt deficiency symptoms have not been found in healthy people who obtain little vitamin E from their diets . Premature babies of very low birth weight (<1,500 grams) might be deficient in vitamin E. Vitamin E supplementation in these infants might reduce the risk of some complications, such as those affecting the retina, but they can also increase the risk of infections . Because the digestive tract requires fat to absorb vitamin E, people with fat-malabsorption disorders are more likely to become deficient than people without such disorders. Deficiency symptoms include peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, skeletal myopathy, retinopathy, and impairment of the immune response . People with Crohn's disease, cystic fibrosis, or an inability to secrete bile from the liver into the digestive tract, for example, often pass greasy stools or have chronic diarrhea; as a result, they sometimes require water-soluble forms of vitamin E, such as tocopheryl polyethylene glycol-1000 succinate . Some people with abetalipoproteinemia, a rare inherited disorder resulting in poor absorption of dietary fat, require enormous doses of supplemental vitamin E (approximately 100 mg/kg or 5–10 g/day) . Vitamin E deficiency secondary to abetalipoproteinemia causes such problems as poor transmission of nerve impulses, muscle weakness, and retinal degeneration that leads to blindness . Ataxia and vitamin E deficiency (AVED) is another rare, inherited disorder in which the liver's alpha-tocopherol transfer protein is defective or absent. People with AVED have such severe vitamin E deficiency that they develop nerve damage and lose the ability to walk unless they take large doses of supplemental vitamin E . Vitamin E and Health Many claims have been made about vitamin E's potential to promote health and prevent and treat disease. The mechanisms by which vitamin E might provide this protection include its function as an antioxidant and its roles in anti-inflammatory processes, inhibition of platelet aggregation, and immune enhancement. A primary barrier to characterizing the roles of vitamin E in health is the lack of validated biomarkers for vitamin E intake and status to help relate intakes to valid predictors of clinical outcomes . This section focuses on four diseases and disorders in which vitamin E might be involved: heart disease, cancer, eye disorders, and cognitive decline. Coronary heart disease Evidence that vitamin E could help prevent or delay coronary heart disease (CHD) comes from several sources. In vitro studies have found that the nutrient inhibits oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, thought to be a crucial initiating step for atherosclerosis . Vitamin E might also help prevent the formation of blood clots that could lead to a heart attack or venous thromboembolism . Several observational studies have associated lower rates of heart disease with higher vitamin E intakes. One study of approximately 90,000 nurses found that the incidence of heart disease was 30% to 40% lower in those with the highest intakes of vitamin E, primarily from supplements . Among a group of 5,133 Finnish men and women followed for a mean of 14 years, higher vitamin E intakes from food were associated with decreased mortality from CHD . However, randomized clinical trials cast doubt on the efficacy of vitamin E supplements to prevent CHD . For example, the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study, which followed almost 10,000 patients at high risk of heart attack or stroke for 4.5 years , found that participants taking 400 IU/day of natural vitamin E (268 mg) experienced no fewer cardiovascular events or hospitalizations for heart failure or chest pain than participants taking a placebo. In the HOPE-TOO follow-up study, almost 4,000 of the original participants continued to take vitamin E or placebo for an additional 2.5 years . HOPE-TOO found that vitamin E provided no significant protection against heart attacks, strokes, unstable angina, or deaths from cardiovascular disease or other causes after 7 years of treatment. Participants taking vitamin E, however, were 13% more likely to experience, and 21% more likely to be hospitalized for, heart failure, a statistically significant but unexpected finding not reported in other large studies. The HOPE and HOPE-TOO trials provide compelling evidence that moderately high doses of vitamin E supplements do not reduce the risk of serious cardiovascular events among men and women >50 years of age with established heart disease or diabetes . These findings are supported by evidence from the Women's Angiographic Vitamin and Estrogen study, in which 423 postmenopausal women with some degree of coronary stenosis took supplements with 400 IU vitamin E (form not specified) and 500 mg vitamin C twice a day or placebo for >4 years . Not only did the supplements provide no cardiovascular benefits, but all-cause mortality was significantly higher in the women taking the supplements. The latest published clinical trial of vitamin E's effects on the heart and blood vessels of women included almost 40,000 healthy women ≥45 years of age who were randomly assigned to receive either 600 IU of natural vitamin E (402 mg) on alternate days or placebo and who were followed for an average of 10 years . The investigators found no significant differences in rates of overall cardiovascular events (combined nonfatal heart attacks, strokes, and cardiovascular deaths) or all-cause mortality between the groups. However, the study did find two positive and significant results for women taking vitamin E: they had a 24% reduction in cardiovascular death rates, and those ≥65 years of age had a 26% decrease in nonfatal heart attack and a 49% decrease in cardiovascular death rates. The most recent published clinical trial of vitamin E and men's cardiovascular health included almost 15,000 healthy physicians ≥50 years of age who were randomly assigned to receive 400 IU synthetic alpha-tocopherol (180 mg) every other day, 500 mg vitamin C daily, both vitamins, or placebo . During a mean follow-up period of 8 years, intake of vitamin E (and/or vitamin C) had no effect on the incidence of major cardiovascular events, myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular morality. Furthermore, use of vitamin E was associated with a significantly increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke. In general, clinical trials have not provided evidence that routine use of vitamin E supplements prevents cardiovascular disease or reduces its morbidity and mortality. However, participants in these studies have been largely middle-aged or elderly individuals with demonstrated heart disease or risk factors for heart disease. Some researchers have suggested that understanding the potential utility of vitamin E in preventing CHD might require longer studies in younger participants taking higher doses of the supplement . Further research is needed to determine whether supplemental vitamin E has any protective value for younger, healthier people at no obvious risk of CHD. Cancer Antioxidant nutrients like vitamin E protect cell constituents from the damaging effects of free radicals that, if unchecked, might contribute to cancer development . Vitamin E might also block the formation of carcinogenic nitrosamines formed in the stomach from nitrites in foods and protect against cancer by enhancing immune function . Unfortunately, human trials and surveys that have attempted to associate vitamin E intake with cancer incidence have found that vitamin E is not beneficial in most cases. Both the HOPE-TOO Trial and Women's Health Study evaluated whether vitamin E supplements might protect people from cancer. HOPE-TOO, which followed men and women ≥55 years of age with heart disease or diabetes for 7 years, found no significant differences in the number of new cancers or cancer deaths between individuals randomly assigned to take 400 IU/day of natural vitamin E (268 mg) or a placebo . In the Women's Health Study, in which healthy women ≥45 years of age received either 600 IU of natural vitamin E (402 mg) every other day or a placebo for 10 years, the supplement did not reduce the risk of developing any form of cancer . Several studies have examined whether vitamin E intake and/or supplemental vitamin E affects the risk of developing prostate cancer. A prospective cohort study of >29,000 men found no association between dietary or supplemental vitamin E intake and prostate cancer risk . However, among current smokers and men who had quit, vitamin E intakes of more than 400 IU/day (form not specified) were associated with a statistically significant 71% reduction in the risk of advanced prostate cancer. In a clinical trial involving 29,133 male smokers, men randomly assigned to take daily supplements of 111 IU of synthetic vitamin E (50 mg, as dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate) for 5–8 years had 32% fewer prostate cancers compared to subjects who did not take the supplements . Based in part on the promising results of this study, a large randomized clinical trial, called the SELECT trial, began in 2001 to determine whether 7–12 years of daily supplementation with 400 IU of synthetic vitamin E (180 mg, as dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate), with or without selenium (200 mcg, as L-selenomethionine), reduced the number of new prostate cancers in 35,533 healthy men age 50 and older. The trial was discontinued in October 2008 when an analysis found that the supplements, taken alone or together for about 5.5 years, did not prevent prostate cancer . Results from an additional 1.5 years of follow-up from this trial (during which the subjects no longer received vitamin E or selenium), showed that the men who had taken the vitamin E had a 17% increased risk of prostate cancer compared to men only taking placebos, a statistically significant difference . The risk of developing prostate cancer was also slightly increased in subjects taking vitamin E plus selenium or selenium alone, but the differences were not statistically significant. No differences were found among groups in the incidence of lung or colorectal cancers or all cancers combined. Study staff members will continue to monitor participants' health for up to 5 more years. The National Cancer Institute website provides additional information on the SELECT trial. One study of women in Iowa provides evidence that higher intakes of vitamin E from foods and supplements could decrease the risk of colon cancer, especially in women <65 years of age . The overall relative risk for the highest quintile of intake (>35.7 IU/day, form not specified) compared to the lowest quintile (<5.7 IU/day, form not specified) was 0.32. However, prospective cohort studies of 87,998 women in the Nurses' Health Study and 47,344 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study failed to replicate these results . Although some research links higher intakes of vitamin E with decreased incidence of breast cancer, an examination of the impact of dietary factors, including vitamin E, on the incidence of postmenopausal breast cancer in >18,000 women found no benefit from the vitamin . The American Cancer Society conducted an epidemiologic study examining the association between use of vitamin C and vitamin E supplements and bladder cancer mortality. Of the almost one million adults followed between 1982 and 1998, adults who took supplemental vitamin E for 10 years or longer had a reduced risk of death from bladder cancer ; vitamin C supplementation provided no protection. Evidence to date is insufficient to support taking vitamin E to prevent cancer. In fact, daily use of large-dose vitamin E supplements (400 IU of synthetic vitamin E [180 mg]) may increase the risk of prostate cancer. Eye disorders Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts are among the most common causes of significant vision loss in older people. Their etiologies are usually unknown, but the cumulative effects of oxidative stress have been postulated to play a role. If so, nutrients with antioxidant functions, such as vitamin E, could be used to prevent or treat these conditions. Prospective cohort studies have found that people with relatively high dietary intakes of vitamin E (e.g., 20 mg/day [30 IU]) have an approximately 20% lower risk of developing AMD than people with low intakes (e.g., <10 mg/day [<15 IU]) . However, two randomized controlled trials in which participants took supplements of vitamin E (500 IU/day [335 mg] d-alpha-tocopherol in one study and 111 IU/day (50 mg) dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate combined with 20 mg/day beta-carotene in the other ) or a placebo failed to show a protective effect for vitamin E on AMD. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS), a large randomized clinical trial, found that participants at high risk of developing advanced AMD (i.e., those with intermediate AMD or those with advanced AMD in one eye) reduced their risk of developing advanced AMD by 25% by taking a daily supplement containing vitamin E (400 IU [180 mg] dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate), beta-carotene (15 mg), vitamin C (500 mg), zinc (80 mg), and copper (2 mg) compared to participants taking a placebo over 5 years . A follow-up AREDS2 study confirmed the value of this and similar supplement formulations in reducing the progression of AMD over a median follow-up period of 5 years . Several observational studies have revealed a potential relationship between vitamin E supplements and the risk of cataract formation. One prospective cohort study found that lens clarity was superior in participants who took vitamin E supplements and those with higher blood levels of the vitamin . In another study, long-term use of vitamin E supplements was associated with slower progression of age-related lens opacification . However, in the AREDS trial, the use of a vitamin E-containing (as dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate) formulation had no apparent effect on the development or progression of cataracts over an average of 6.3 years . The AREDS2 study, which also tested formulations containing 400 IU (180 mg) vitamin E, confirmed these findings . Overall, the available evidence is inconsistent with respect to whether vitamin E supplements, taken alone or in combination with other antioxidants, can reduce the risk of developing AMD or cataracts. However, the formulations of vitamin E, other antioxidants, zinc, and copper used in AREDS hold promise for slowing the progression of AMD in people at high risk of developing advanced AMD. Cognitive decline The brain has a high oxygen consumption rate and abundant polyunsaturated fatty acids in the neuronal cell membranes. Researchers hypothesize that if cumulative free-radical damage to neurons over time contributes to cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, then ingestion of sufficient or supplemental antioxidants (such as vitamin E) might provide some protection . This hypothesis was supported by the results of a clinical trial in 341 patients with Alzheimer's disease of moderate severity who were randomly assigned to receive a placebo, vitamin E (2,000 IU/day dl-alpha-tocopherol), a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (selegiline), or vitamin E and selegiline . Over 2 years, treatment with vitamin E and selegiline, separately or together, significantly delayed functional deterioration and the need for institutionalization compared to placebo. However, participants taking vitamin E experienced significantly more falls. Vitamin E consumption from foods or supplements was associated with less cognitive decline over 3 years in a prospective cohort study of elderly, free-living individuals age 65–102 years . However, a clinical trial in primarily healthy older women who were randomly assigned to receive 600 IU (402 mg) d-alpha-tocopherol every other day or a placebo for ≤4 years found that the supplements provided no apparent cognitive benefits . Another trial in which 769 men and women with mild cognitive impairment were randomly assigned to receive 2,000 IU/day vitamin E (form not specified), a cholinesterase inhibitor (donepezil), or placebo found no significant differences in the progression rate of Alzheimer's disease between the vitamin E and placebo groups In summary, most research results do not support the use of vitamin E supplements by healthy or mildly impaired individuals to maintain cognitive performance or slow its decline with normal aging . More research is needed to identify the role of vitamin E, if any, in the management of cognitive impairment . Health Risks from Excessive Vitamin E Research has not found any adverse effects from consuming vitamin E in food . However, high doses of alpha-tocopherol supplements can cause hemorrhage and interrupt blood coagulation in animals, and in vitro data suggest that high doses inhibit platelet aggregation. Two clinical trials have found an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke in participants taking alpha-tocopherol; one trial included Finnish male smokers who consumed 50 mg/day for an average of 6 years and the other trial involved a large group of male physicians in the United States who consumed 400 IU (180 mg) of synthetic vitamin E every other day for 8 years . Because the majority of physicians in the latter study were also taking aspirin, this finding could indicate that vitamin E has a tendency to cause bleeding. The FNB has established ULs for vitamin E based on the potential for hemorrhagic effects (see Table 3). The ULs apply to all forms of supplemental alpha-tocopherol, including the eight stereoisomers present in synthetic vitamin E. Doses of up to 1,000 mg/day (1,500 IU/day of the natural form or 1,100 IU/day of the synthetic form) in adults appear to be safe, although the data are limited and based on small groups of people taking up to 3,200 mg/day of alpha-tocopherol for only a few weeks or months. Long-term intakes above the UL increase the risk of adverse health effects . Vitamin E ULs for infants have not been established. Table 3: Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for Vitamin E 1–3 years: Male: 200 mg, Female: 200 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  4–8 years: Male: 300 mg, Female: 300 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation: ,  9–13 years: Male: 600 mg, Female: 600 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  14–18 years: Male: 800 mg, Female: 800 mg, Pregnancy: 800 mg, Lactation: 800 mg 19+ years: Male: 1,000 mg, Female: 1,000 mg, Pregnancy: 1,000 mg, Lactation: 1,000 mg Two meta-analyses of randomized trials have also raised questions about the safety of large doses of vitamin E, including doses lower than the UL. These meta-analyses linked supplementation to small but statistically significant increases in all-cause mortality. One analysis found an increased risk of death at doses of 400 IU/day (form not specified), although the risk began to increase at 150 IU . In the other analysis of studies of antioxidant supplements for disease prevention, the highest quality trials revealed that vitamin E, administered singly (dose range 10 IU–5,000 IU/day; mean 569 IU [form not specified]) or combined with up to four other antioxidants, significantly increased mortality risk . The implications of these analyses for the potential adverse effects of high-dose vitamin E supplements are unclear [56-59]. Participants in the studies included in these analyses were typically middle-aged or older and had chronic diseases or related risk factors. These participants often consumed other supplements in addition to vitamin E. Some of the studies analyzed took place in developing countries in which nutritional deficiencies are common. A review of the subset of studies in which vitamin E supplements were given to healthy individuals for the primary prevention of chronic disease found no convincing evidence that the supplements increased mortality . However, results from the recently published, large SELECT trial show that vitamin E supplements (400 IU/day [180 mg] as dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate) may harm adult men in the general population by increasing their risk of prostate cancer . Follow-up studies are assessing whether the cancer risk was associated with baseline blood levels of vitamin E and selenium prior to supplementation as well as whether changes in one or more genes might increase a man's risk of developing prostate cancer while taking vitamin E. Interactions with Medications Vitamin E supplements have the potential to interact with several types of medications. A few examples are provided below. People taking these and other medications on a regular basis should discuss their vitamin E intakes with their health care providers. Anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications Vitamin E can inhibit platelet aggregation and antagonize vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. As a result, taking large doses with anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications, such as warfarin (Coumadin), can increase the risk of bleeding, especially in conjunction with low vitamin K intake. The amounts of supplemental vitamin E needed to produce clinically significant effects are unknown but probably exceed 400 IU/day . Simvastatin and niacin Some people take vitamin E supplements with other antioxidants, such as vitamin C, selenium, and beta-carotene. This collection of antioxidant ingredients blunted the rise in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, especially levels of HDL2, the most cardioprotective HDL component, among people treated with a combination of simvastatin (brand name Zocor) and niacin . Chemotherapy and radiotherapy Oncologists generally advise against the use of antioxidant supplements during cancer chemotherapy or radiotherapy because they might reduce the effectiveness of these therapies by inhibiting cellular oxidative damage in cancerous cells . Although a systematic review of randomized controlled trials has called this concern into question , further research is needed to evaluate the potential risks and benefits of concurrent antioxidant supplementation with conventional therapies for cancer. Vitamin E and Healthful Diets The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\" For more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate.

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet. Introduction Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in some foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement and a prescription medication. Because vitamin B12 contains the mineral cobalt, compounds with vitamin B12 activity are collectively called cobalamins . Methylcobalamin and 5-deoxyadenosylcobalamin are the metabolically active forms of vitamin B12. However, two others forms, hydroxycobalamin and cyanocobalamin, become biologically active after they are converted to methylcobalamin or 5-deoxyadenosylcobalamin [1-3]. Vitamin B12 is required for the development, myelination, and function of the central nervous system; healthy red blood cell formation; and DNA synthesis . Vitamin B12 functions as a cofactor for two enzymes, methionine synthase and L-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase [1-3,5]. Methionine synthase catalyzes the conversion of homocysteine to the essential amino acid methionine . Methionine is required for the formation of S-adenosylmethionine, a universal methyl donor for almost 100 different substrates, including DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipids . L-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase converts L-methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA in the metabolism of propionate, a short-chain fatty acid . Vitamin B12 is bound to protein in food and must be released before it is absorbed . The process starts in the mouth when food is mixed with saliva. The freed vitamin B12 then binds with haptocorrin, a cobalamin-binding protein in the saliva. More vitamin B12 is released from its food matrix by the activity of hydrochloric acid and gastric protease in the stomach, where it then binds to haptocorrin . In the duodenum, digestive enzymes free the vitamin B12 from haptocorrin, and this freed vitamin B12 combines with intrinsic factor, a transport and delivery binding protein secreted by the stomach’s parietal cells. The resulting complex is absorbed in the distal ileum by receptor-mediated endocytosis . If vitamin B12 is added to fortified foods and dietary supplements, it is already in free form and therefore does not require the separation step. Vitamin B12 status is typically assessed by measurements of serum or plasma vitamin B12 levels. The cutoff between normal vitamin B12 levels and deficiency varies by method and laboratory, but most laboratories define subnormal serum or plasma values as those lower than 200 or 250 pg/mL (148 or 185 pmol/L) . Levels of serum methylmalonic acid (MMA), a vitamin B12-associated metabolite, are the most sensitive markers of vitamin B12 status, and an MMA level greater than 0.271 micromol/L suggests vitamin B12 deficiency [6-8]. However, MMA levels also rise with renal insufficiency and tend to be higher in older adults . Another marker is total plasma homocysteine levels, which rise quickly as vitamin B12 status declines; a serum homocysteine level higher than 15 micromol/L, for example, suggests vitamin B12 deficiency . However, this indicator has poor specificity because it is influenced by other factors, such as low folate levels and, especially, by declines in kidney function . Experts suggest that if a patient’s serum vitamin B12 level is between 150 to 399 pg/mL (111 to 294 pmol/L), the patient’s serum MMA levels should be checked to help confirm a diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency . Recommended Intakes Intake recommendations for vitamin B12 and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine . DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following: Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects Table 1 lists the current RDAs for vitamin B12 . For adults, the main criterion that the FNB used to establish the RDAs was the amount needed to maintain a healthy hematological status and serum vitamin B12 levels. For infants age 0 to 12 months, the FNB established an AI that is equivalent to the mean intake of vitamin B12 in healthy, breastfed infants. Table 1: Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for Vitamin B12 Birth to 6 months*: Male: 0.4 mcg, Female: 0.4 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  7–12 months*: Male: 0.5 mcg, Female: 0.5 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  1–3 years: Male: 0.9 mcg, Female: 0.9 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  4–8 years: Male: 1.2 mcg, Female: 1.2 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  9–13 years: Male: 1.8 mcg, Female: 1.8 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  14–18 years: Male: 2.4 mcg, Female: 2.4 mcg, Pregnancy: 2.6 mcg, Lactation: 2.8 mcg 19+ years: Male: 2.4 mcg, Female: 2.4 mcg, Pregnancy: 2.6 mcg, Lactation: 2.8 mcg * Adequate Intake (AI) Sources of Vitamin B12 Food Vitamin B12 is present in foods of animal origin, including fish, meat, poultry, eggs, and dairy products . Plant foods do not naturally contain vitamin B12. However, fortified breakfast cereals and fortified nutritional yeasts are readily available sources of vitamin B12 that have high bioavailability . The average vitamin B12 level in the breast milk of women with vitamin B12 intakes above the RDA is 0.44 mcg/L . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) specifies that infant formulas sold in the United States must provide at least 0.15 mcg vitamin B12 per 100 kcal . The estimated bioavailability of vitamin B12 from food varies by vitamin B12 dose because absorption decreases drastically when the capacity of intrinsic factor is exceeded (at 1–2 mcg of vitamin B12) . Bioavailability also varies by type of food source. For example, the bioavailability of vitamin B12 appears to be about three times higher in dairy products than in meat, fish, and poultry, and the bioavailability of vitamin B12 from dietary supplements is about 50% higher than that from food sources [18-20]. A variety of foods and their vitamin B12 levels per serving are listed in Table 2. Table 2: Vitamin B12 Content of Selected Foods Beef liver, cooked, pan fried, 3 ounces: Micrograms per serving: 70.7, Percent DV*: 2,944 Clams (without shells), cooked, 3 ounces: Micrograms per serving: 17, Percent DV*: 708 Oysters, eastern, wild, cooked, 3 ounces: Micrograms per serving: 14.9, Percent DV*: 621 Nutritional yeast, fortified, from several brands (check label), about ¼ cup: Micrograms per serving: 8.3 to 24, Percent DV*: 346 to 1,000 Salmon, Atlantic, cooked, 3 ounces: Micrograms per serving: 2.6, Percent DV*: 108 Tuna, light, canned in water, 3 ounces: Micrograms per serving: 2.5, Percent DV*: 104 Beef, ground, 85% lean meat/15% fat, pan browned, 3 ounces: Micrograms per serving: 2.4, Percent DV*: 100 Milk, 2% milkfat, 1 cup: Micrograms per serving: 1.3, Percent DV*: 54 Yogurt, plain, fat free, 6-ounce container: Micrograms per serving: 1.0, Percent DV*: 43 Breakfast cereals, fortified with 25% of the DV for vitamin B12, 1 serving: Micrograms per serving: 0.6, Percent DV*: 25 Cheese, cheddar, 1½ ounces: Micrograms per serving: 0.5, Percent DV*: 19 Egg, whole, cooked, 1 large: Micrograms per serving: 0.5, Percent DV*: 19 Turkey, breast meat, roasted, 3 ounces: Micrograms per serving: 0.3, Percent DV*: 14 Tempeh, 1/2 cup: Micrograms per serving: 0.1, Percent DV*: 3 Banana, 1 medium: Micrograms per serving: 0.0, Percent DV*: 0 Bread, whole wheat, 1 slice: Micrograms per serving: 0.0, Percent DV*: 0 Strawberries, raw, halved, 1/2 cup: Micrograms per serving: 0.0, Percent DV*: 0 Beans, kidney, boiled, 1/2 cup: Micrograms per serving: 0.0, Percent DV*: 0 Spinach, boiled, drained, 1/2 cup: Micrograms per serving: 0.0, Percent DV*: 0 *DV = Daily Value. FDA developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for vitamin B12 is 2.4 mcg for adults and children age 4 years and older . FDA does not require food labels to list vitamin B12 content unless vitamin B12 has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA's) FoodData Central lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides a comprehensive list of foods containing vitamin B12 arranged by nutrient content and by food name. Dietary supplements Vitamin B12 is available in multivitamin/mineral supplements, in supplements containing other B-complex vitamins, and in supplements containing only vitamin B12. Multivitamin/mineral supplements typically contain vitamin B12 at doses ranging from 5 to 25 mcg . Vitamin B12 levels are higher, generally 50–500 mcg, in supplements containing vitamin B12 with other B-complex vitamins and even higher, typically 500–1,000 mcg, in supplements containing only vitamin B12. The most common form of vitamin B12 in dietary supplements is cyanocobalamin . Other forms of vitamin B12 in supplements are adenosylcobalamin, methylcobalamin, and hydroxycobalamin . No evidence indicates that absorption rates of vitamin B12 in supplements vary by form of the vitamin. These rates are about 50% at doses (less than 1–2 mcg) that do not exceed the cobalamin-binding capacity of intrinsic factor and are substantially lower at doses well above 1–2 mcg . For example, absorption is only about 2% at doses of 500 mcg and 1.3% at doses of 1,000 mcg . In addition to oral dietary supplements, vitamin B12 is available in sublingual preparations as tablets or lozenges . Evidence suggests no difference in efficacy between oral and sublingual forms . Prescription medications Vitamin B12, in the forms of cyanocobalamin and hydroxycobalamin, can be administered parenterally as a prescription medication, usually by intramuscular injection . Parenteral administration is typically used to treat vitamin B12 deficiency caused by pernicious anemia as well as other conditions (e.g., tropical sprue, pancreatic insufficiency) that result in vitamin B12 malabsorption and severe vitamin B12 deficiency . Vitamin B12 is also available as a prescription nasal gel spray. This formulation appears to be effective in raising vitamin B12 blood levels in adults and children . A small clinical study with 10 participants (mean age 81 years) found that the bioavailability of a 1,000 mcg cobalamin dose was 2% with intranasal administration, which is similar to the bioavailability of an oral dose . Vitamin B12 Intakes and Status Most people in the United States consume adequate amounts of vitamin B12. Data from the 2017–March 2020 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) show that mean daily intakes of vitamin B12 from food and beverages were 5.84 mcg for men age 20 and older and 3.69 mcg for women . For children and adolescents age 2 to 19, mean daily intakes of vitamin B12 ranged from 3.66 mcg to 4.52 mcg . Only 5% of U.S. men and 11% of women had intakes from food and beverages below the vitamin B12 EAR of 2 mcg . People of low socioeconomic status, women, and non-Hispanic Blacks are most likely to have low vitamin B12 intakes . Approximately 24% of men and 29% of women reported using a dietary supplement containing vitamin B12 in NHANES 2017–March 2020 . The proportion in children and adolescents ranged from 28% of those age 2 to 5 years to 9% of those age 12 to 19. Mean daily vitamin B12 intakes among supplement users from food, beverages, and supplements were 297.3 mcg for men age 20 and older, 407.4 mcg for women, and from 24.7 to 47.4 mcg for children and adolescents. According to an analysis of NHANES data from 2007–2018, approximately 3.6% of all adults age 19 and older have vitamin B12 deficiency (assessed as serum vitamin B12 <200 pg/mL [148 pmol/L]), and the rate is 3.7% in those age 60 and older . However, vitamin B12 insufficiency (assessed as serum vitamin B12 <300 pg/mL [221 pmol/L]) is more prevalent, affecting approximately 12.5% of all adults age 19 and older, and 12.3% of those age 60 and older . During pregnancy, serum vitamin B12 levels tend to drop, sometimes to subnormal levels, but they usually return to normal after delivery . Vitamin B12 Deficiency Causes of vitamin B12 deficiency include difficulty absorbing vitamin B12 from food, lack of intrinsic factor (e.g., because of pernicious anemia), surgery in the gastrointestinal tract, prolonged use of certain medications (e.g., metformin or proton pump inhibitors, discussed in more detail below in the section on interactions with medications), and dietary deficiency . Because people who have difficulty absorbing vitamin B12 from food absorb free vitamin B12 normally, their vitamin B12 deficiency tends to be less severe than that of individuals with pernicious anemia, who cannot absorb either food-bound or free vitamin B12. Certain congenital conditions, such as hereditary intrinsic factor defects and congenital vitamin B12 malabsorption (Imerslund-Gräsbeck disease), can also cause severe vitamin B12 deficiency . The effects of vitamin B12 deficiency can include the hallmark megaloblastic anemia (characterized by large, abnormally nucleated red blood cells) as well as low counts of white and red blood cells, platelets, or a combination; glossitis of the tongue; fatigue; palpitations; pale skin; dementia; weight loss; and infertility . Neurological changes, such as numbness and tingling in the hands and feet, can also occur . These neurological symptoms can occur without anemia, so early diagnosis and intervention is important to avoid irreversible damage . In addition, some studies have found associations between vitamin B12 deficiency or low vitamin B12 intakes and depression [37-39]. In pregnant and breastfeeding women, vitamin B12 deficiency might cause neural tube defects, developmental delays, failure to thrive, and anemia in offspring . Because the body stores about 1 to 5 mg vitamin B12 (or about 1,000 to 2,000 times as much as the amount typically consumed in a day), the symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency can take several years to appear . Vitamin B12 deficiency with the classic hematologic and neurologic signs and symptoms is uncommon . However, low or marginal vitamin B12 status (200–300 pg/mL [148–221 pmol/L]) without these symptoms is much more common, at up to 40% in Western populations, especially in those with low intakes of vitamin B12-rich foods . The prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency varies by cutoff level and biomarker used. For example, among adults age 19 and older who participated in NHANES between 1999 and 2004, the rate of low vitamin B12 levels in serum was 3% with a cutoff of less than 200 pg/mL (148 pmol/L) and 26% with a cutoff of less than 350 pg/mL (258 pmol/L) . Approximately 21% of adults older than 60 had abnormal levels of at least one vitamin B12 biomarker . Typically, vitamin B12 deficiency is treated with vitamin B12 injections because this method bypasses any barriers to absorption. However, high doses of oral vitamin B12 might also be effective. A 2018 Cochrane Review included three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared very high doses (1,000–2,000 mcg) of oral with intramuscular vitamin B12 for vitamin B12 deficiency in a total of 153 participants . The evidence from these studies, although of low quality, showed that the ability of high oral doses of vitamin B12 supplements to normalize serum vitamin B12 was similar to that of intramuscular vitamin B12. Groups at Risk of Vitamin B12 Inadequacy The following groups are among those most likely to be vitamin B12 deficient. Older adults Depending on the definition used, between 3% and 43% of community-dwelling older adults, especially those with atrophic gastritis, have vitamin B12 deficiency based on serum vitamin B12 levels . The deficiency rate at a cutoff of less than 211 pg/mL (156 pmol/L) at admission to a long-term care facility, according to one study, was 14%, and 38% of these older adults had levels lower than 407 pg/mL (300 pmol/L) . Conditions associated with vitamin B12 inadequacy include pernicious anemia, present in about 15% to 25% of older adults with vitamin B12 deficiency . Atrophic gastritis, an autoimmune condition affecting 2% of the general population but 8%–9% of adults age 65 and older, decreases production of intrinsic factor and secretion of hydrochloric acid in the stomach and thus decreases absorption of vitamin B12 . A third condition associated with vitamin B12 deficiency in older adults is Helicobacter pylori infection, possibly because this bacterium causes inflammation that leads to malabsorption of vitamin B12 from food . Individuals with pernicious anemia Pernicious anemia is an irreversible autoimmune disease that affects the gastric mucosa and results in gastric atrophy . This disease leads to attacks on parietal cells in the stomach, resulting in failure to produce intrinsic factor and malabsorption of dietary vitamin B12, recycled biliary vitamin B12, and free vitamin B12 .Therefore, without treatment, pernicious anemia causes vitamin B12 deficiency, even in the presence of adequate vitamin B12 intakes. Pernicious anemia is the most common cause of clinically evident vitamin B12 deficiency around the world . The incidence of pernicious anemia in the United States is an estimated 151 per 100,000, and this condition is more common in women and in people of European ancestry . Individuals with gastrointestinal disorders Individuals with stomach and small intestine disorders, such as celiac disease and Crohn’s disease, may be unable to absorb enough vitamin B12 from food to maintain healthy body stores . However, although rates of vitamin B12 deficiency are higher in people with celiac disease than other people , the evidence for whether rates of vitamin B12 deficiency are higher in people with Crohn’s disease is mixed . Vitamin B12 deficiency in people with Crohn’s disease is typically treated with intramuscular cobalamin injections, but high doses of oral cyanocobalamin therapy (e.g., 1,000 mcg/day) might be equally effective . Individuals who have had gastrointestinal surgery Surgical procedures in the gastrointestinal tract, such as for weight loss or to remove all or part of the stomach, can cause a complete or partial loss of cells that secrete hydrochloric acid and cells that secrete intrinsic factor . Thus, these procedures reduce the amount of vitamin B12, particularly food-bound vitamin B12, that the body absorbs . High doses (1,000 mcg/day) of oral methylcobalamin supplements appear to be as effective as hydroxycobalamin injections in normalizing vitamin B12 values in patients who have undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery . Vegetarians Vegans who consume no animal products and vegetarians who consume some animal products (e.g., dairy products, eggs, or both) but not meat have a higher risk of developing vitamin B12 deficiency because natural food sources of vitamin B12 are limited to animal foods . Consumption of foods fortified with vitamin B12 (such as fortified nutritional yeasts) as well as vitamin B12 supplements can substantially reduce the risk of deficiency . Infants of vegan women Exclusively breastfed infants of women who consume no animal products might have very limited reserves of vitamin B12 and can develop vitamin B12 deficiency, sometimes very early in life . The infant’s deficiency can be severe, especially if the mother’s deficiency is severe or caused by pernicious anemia; sometimes, the mother’s own deficiency is clinically mild and not recognized. Undetected and untreated vitamin B12 deficiency in infants can result in neurological damage, failure to thrive, developmental delays, and anemia . The reasons include the small amounts of vitamin B12 in the breast milk of vegan mothers as well as the limited amounts of vitamin B12 crossing the placenta in these women during fetal development. Vitamin B12 and Health This section focuses on areas of health in which vitamin B12 might be involved: cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke, dementia and cognitive function, and energy and endurance. Cancer The evidence for a relationship between vitamin B12 and cancer risk is mixed. Some evidence supports a link between increased cancer risk and higher intakes or blood concentrations of vitamin B12, some supports a link with lower intakes or concentrations, and some evidence indicates no link at all. Observational evidence supporting an association between higher vitamin B12 levels and increased cancer risk includes an analysis of data on 757,185 people (median age 56 years) with plasma vitamin B12 measurements . The results showed that the adjusted 1-year risk of cancer was 1.74 to 4.72 times higher among those with vitamin B12 levels above 813 pg/mL (600 pmol/L) than those with levels in the normal range of 203–813 pg/mL (150–600 pmol/L). An analysis by some of the same investigators of data from Danish medical registries for 25,017 people who had a cancer diagnosis between 1998 and 2014 found 1-year survival rates of 35.8% in those whose plasma cobalamin levels were higher than 1,084 pg/mL (800 pmol/L) and 69.3% in those with levels between 271 and 813 pg/mL (200–600 pmol/L) . Some observational evidence also shows an association between supplements containing vitamin B12 and a higher risk of certain types of cancer. For example, an assessment of 77,118 participants age 50 to 76 years in the Vitamins and Lifestyle cohort study found that use of at least 55 mcg/day supplemental vitamin B12 for an average of 10 years was associated with a 40% higher risk of lung cancer in men . However, the study found no association between supplemental vitamin B12 use and cancer risk in women. Limited clinical trial evidence supports the finding that higher vitamin B12 intakes might increase cancer risk. In an analysis of data on 2,524 participants in the B Vitamins for the Prevention of Osteoporotic Fractures trial who were treated with supplements containing 400 mcg/day folic acid and 500 mcg/day vitamin B12 for 2 to 3 years, the risk of colorectal cancer was significantly higher, at 3.4%, in the supplementation group than in the placebo group, whose rate was 2% . However, high folic acid levels are potentially linked to increased risk of colorectal cancer, so the result might be due to the folic acid rather than the vitamin B12 . Furthermore, the supplements had no significant effect on overall cancer risk. Some observational evidence shows no association between high vitamin B12 concentrations or intakes and increased risk of certain cancers. For example, higher vitamin B12 intakes or serum concentrations were not associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer , breast cancer , or esophageal cancer or gastric cancer . Clinical trials support the lack of association between higher vitamin B12 intakes and cancer risk. [68-70]. For example, a meta-analysis of 18 RCTs that included 74,498 individuals found that supplements containing B vitamins, including 20 to 2,000 mcg/day vitamin B12, had little or no effect on cancer incidence, cancer deaths, or all-cause mortality during follow-up periods of 2 to 7.3 years . Finally, evidence pointing to an association between lower vitamin B12 levels and a higher cancer risk includes observational data showing a risk of gastric cancer that was 5.8 times higher in male smokers with lower vitamin B12 levels (less than 394 pg/mL [291 pmol/L]) than in those with levels higher than 591 pg/mL (436 pmol/L) . Also, two meta-analyses found associations between lower vitamin B12 concentrations or intakes and a higher risk of colorectal cancer and prostate cancer . More evidence is needed to clarify whether high or low intakes of vitamin B12 influence the risk of cancer as well as the role of vitamin B12 in preventing cancer. Cardiovascular disease and stroke An elevated homocysteine level has been associated with an increased risk of CVD . Vitamin B12 and other B vitamins are involved in homocysteine metabolism, and researchers have hypothesized that supplementation with these micronutrients can reduce CVD risk by lowering homocysteine levels . However, studies on the association between vitamin B12 intake and risk of CVD have had negative results. Two meta-analyses—one of 11 prospective cohort studies in 369,746 individuals who developed 5,133 cases of coronary heart disease and one of 12 prospective (mostly cohort) studies in 389,938 participants who developed 10,749 cases of stroke over 4.2 to 19 years (including 10 reports that evaluated the association between dietary vitamin B12 intake and stroke risk)—found no significant association between vitamin B12 intakes and risk of coronary heart disease or stroke . RCTs have found that vitamin B12 (and folic acid) supplements lower homocysteine levels but not CVD risk. The authors of a Cochrane Review of the effects of homocysteine-lowering interventions on cardiovascular events based on 15 studies in 71,422 participants concluded that supplements of vitamin B12 alone or with other B vitamins do not prevent heart attacks or reduce death rates in people at risk of or with CVD . More recently, an extended follow-up of the B-PROOF trial, (which compared 400 mcg folic acid and 500 mcg vitamin B-12 daily with placebo) in 1,298 participants found that after a median of 54 months, the intervention had no effect on CVD risk . Overall, the available evidence suggests that supplementation with vitamin B12 alone or in combination with other B-vitamins does not reduce the risk of CVD or of CVD-related death. Dementia and cognitive function Observational studies have shown positive associations between elevated homocysteine levels and the incidence of both Alzheimer’s disease and dementia [80-83]. Scientists hypothesize that elevated homocysteine levels might have a negative effect on the brain via numerous mechanisms, including cerebrovascular ischemia leading to neuronal cell death, activation of tau kinases leading to tangle deposition, and inhibition of methylation reactions . Most observational studies have found correlations between low serum vitamin B12 concentrations alone or in combination with high folate concentrations and poor cognitive function [84-89]. For example, an analysis of cross-sectional 2011–2014 NHANES data on 2,420 adults age 60 years or older found that low vitamin B12 (MMA greater than 0.27 micromol/L or serum vitamin B12 less than 203 pg/mL [150 pmol/L]) combined with high folic acid—unmetabolized serum folic acid greater than 0.44 mcg/L (1 nmol/L) or serum total folate higher than 32.7 mcg/L (74.1 nmol/L)—was associated with an almost two to three times higher risk of cognitive impairment . However, a few observational studies have found no such association . In addition, according to a systematic review of 35 prospective cohort studies in 14,325 participants age 47 to 101 years followed for an average of 5.4 years, the evidence does not support a role for low vitamin B12 in the development of cognitive impairment or dementia . In general, evidence from RCTs does not show that vitamin B12 supplementation alone or with folic acid, vitamin B6, or both for 1 to 2 years improves cognitive function in older adults with or without dementia, mild cognitive impairment, or Alzheimer’s disease, even though supplementation lowers homocysteine levels [93-96]. For example, an RCT administered 400 mcg/day folic acid and 500 mcg/day vitamin B12 (B-vitamin group) or a placebo for 2 years to 2,919 adults age 65 and older with homocysteine levels of 12 to 50 mcmol/L . Although homocysteine concentrations declined significantly more (by 5.0 mcmol/L) in the supplementation group than in the placebo group (1.3 mcmol/L), cognitive test scores did not differ between groups. A Cochrane Review of vitamin and mineral supplements to maintain cognitive function in cognitively healthy people included 14 studies that compared folic acid, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, or a combination of these supplements to placebo in 27,882 participants, most of whom were age 60 years or older . The supplements had little to no effect on global cognitive function when administered for up to 5 years and appeared to have no impact when administered for 5 to 10 years. Similarly, supplementation with vitamin B12 alone or with other B vitamins does not appear to decrease the risk or slow the progression of dementia or Alzheimer’s disease in older adults. A Cochrane Review evaluated the effects of vitamin and mineral supplements on cognitive function and dementia in people with mild cognitive impairment . The review included five trials with 879 participants that investigated B vitamin supplements (one study of folic acid only and four trials of vitamins B6 and B12 and folic acid). Taking these B vitamins for 6 to 24 months had no apparent effect on episodic memory, executive function, speed of processing, or quality of life, although one study found a slower rate of brain atrophy over 2 years. Additional clinical trials are needed to better understand the effects of vitamin B12 supplementation on cognitive function and cognitive decline. Energy and endurance Because of its role in energy metabolism, vitamin B12 is often promoted as an energy enhancer and an athletic performance and endurance booster. However, vitamin B12 supplementation appears to have no beneficial effect on performance in the absence of a nutritional deficit . Health Risks from Excessive Vitamin B12 The FNB did not establish a UL for vitamin B12 because of its low potential for toxicity . Even at large doses, vitamin B12 is generally considered to be safe because the body does not store excess amounts. Interactions with Medications Vitamin B12 has the potential to interact with certain medications. In addition, several types of medications might adversely affect vitamin B12 levels. A few examples are provided below. Individuals taking these and other medications on a regular basis should discuss their vitamin B12 status with their health care providers. Gastric acid inhibitors Gastric acid inhibitors include proton pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole (Prilosec) and lansoprazole (Prevacid), and histamine 2-receptor antagonists, such as cimetidine (Tagamet) and ranitidine (Zantac). These drugs are used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease and peptic ulcer disease. They can interfere with vitamin B12 absorption from food by slowing the release of gastric acid into the stomach and thereby lead to vitamin B12 deficiency [101-103]. Metformin Metformin, an antihyperglycemic agent used as first-line treatment for prediabetes and diabetes, might reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 and significantly reduce serum vitamin B12 concentrations . Vitamin B12 and Healthful Diets The federal government’s 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\" For more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that Includes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils. Milk and milk products are good sources of vitamin B12. Many ready-to-eat breakfast cereals are fortified with vitamin B12.

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet. Introduction Calcium, the most abundant mineral in the body, is found in some foods, added to others, present in some medicines (such as antacids), and available as a dietary supplement. Calcium makes up much of the structure of bones and teeth and allows normal bodily movement by keeping tissue rigid, strong, and flexible . The small ionized pool of calcium in the circulatory system, extracellular fluid, and various tissues mediates blood vessel contraction and dilation, muscle function, blood clotting, nerve transmission, and hormonal secretion . Calcium from foods and dietary supplements is absorbed by both active transport and by passive diffusion across the intestinal mucosa . Active transport is responsible for most absorption when calcium intakes are lower, and passive diffusion accounts for an increasing proportion of calcium absorption as intakes rise. Vitamin D is required for calcium to be absorbed in the gut by active transport and to maintain adequate calcium levels in blood . Almost all (98%) calcium in the body is stored in the bones, and the body uses the bones as a reservoir for, and source of, calcium to maintain calcium homeostasis . More than 99% of calcium in the body is in the form of calcium hydroxyapatite, an inorganic matrix of calcium and phosphate that is stored in the bones and teeth . Unlike teeth, bone undergoes continuous remodeling, with constant resorption and deposition of calcium into new bone . Bone remodeling is required to change bone size during growth, repair damage, maintain serum calcium levels, and provide a source of other minerals . At birth, the body contains about 26 to 30 g calcium. This amount rises quickly after birth, reaching about 1,200 g in women and 1,400 g in men by adulthood . These levels remain constant in men, but they start to drop in women as a result of increases in bone remodeling due to decreased estrogen production at the start of menopause . An inverse relationship exists between calcium intake and absorption. Absorption of calcium from food is about 45% at intakes of 200 mg/day but only 15% when intakes are higher than 2,000 mg/day . Age can also affect absorption of dietary calcium . Net absorption of dietary calcium is as high as 60% in infants and young children, who need substantial amounts to build bone, but it decreases to about 25% in adulthood and continues to decline with age . Total calcium levels can be measured in serum or plasma; serum levels are typically 8.8 to 10.4 mg/dL (2.2 to 2.6 mmol/L) in healthy people . However, serum levels do not reflect nutritional status because of their tight homeostatic control . Levels of ionized (or free) calcium, the biologically active form, in serum are also used to measure calcium status. The normal range of ionized calcium in healthy people is 4.6 to 5.3 mg/dL (1.15 to 1.33 mmol/L) . Dual x-ray absorptiometry testing of bone mineral density can be used to assess cumulative calcium status over the lifetime because the skeleton stores almost all calcium in the body . Recommended Intakes Intake recommendations for calcium and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine . DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following: Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects Table 1 lists the current RDAs for calcium . For adults, the main criterion that the FNB used to establish the RDAs was the amount needed to promote bone maintenance and neutral calcium balance. For infants age 0 to 12 months, the FNB established an AI that is equivalent to the mean intake of calcium in healthy, breastfed infants. For children and adolescents, the RDAs are based on intakes associated with bone accumulation and positive calcium balance. Table 1: Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for Calcium 0–6 months*: Male: 200 mg, Female: 200 mg, Pregnant: , Lactating:  7–12 months*: Male: 260 mg, Female: 260 mg, Pregnant: , Lactating:  1–3 years: Male: 700 mg, Female: 700 mg, Pregnant: , Lactating:  4–8 years: Male: 1,000 mg, Female: 1,000 mg, Pregnant: , Lactating:  9–13 years: Male: 1,300 mg, Female: 1,300 mg, Pregnant: , Lactating:  14–18 years: Male: 1,300 mg, Female: 1,300 mg, Pregnant: 1,300 mg, Lactating: 1,300 mg 19–50 years: Male: 1,000 mg, Female: 1,000 mg, Pregnant: 1,000 mg, Lactating: 1,000 mg 51–70 years: Male: 1,000 mg, Female: 1,200 mg, Pregnant: , Lactating:  >70+ years: Male: 1,200 mg, Female: 1,200 mg, Pregnant: , Lactating:  *Adequate Intake (AI) Sources of Calcium Food Milk, yogurt, and cheese are rich natural sources of calcium . In the United States, approximately 72% of calcium intakes come from dairy products and foods with added dairy ingredients . Nondairy sources include canned sardines and salmon with bones as well as certain vegetables, such as kale, broccoli, and Chinese cabbage (bok choi). Most grains do not have high amounts of calcium unless they are fortified. However, they contribute to calcium intakes, even though they contain small amounts of calcium, because people consume them frequently . Foods fortified with calcium in the United States include many fruit juices and drinks, tofu, and ready-to-eat cereals . Calcium citrate malate is a well-absorbed form of calcium used in some fortified juices . Calcium absorption varies by type of food. The absorption of calcium from dairy products and fortified foods is about 30% . Certain compounds in plants (e.g., oxalic acid, phytic acid) can decrease calcium absorption by forming indigestible salts with calcium, decreasing its absorption . As a result, absorption of calcium is only 5% for spinach, whereas it is much higher, at 27%, for milk . In addition to spinach, foods with high levels of oxalic acid include collard greens, sweet potatoes, rhubarb, and beans . The bioavailability of calcium from other plants that do not contain these compounds—including broccoli, kale, and cabbage—is similar to that of milk, although the amount of calcium per serving is much lower . When people eat many different types of foods, these interactions with oxalic or phytic acid probably have little or no nutritional consequences. Net absorption of dietary calcium is also reduced to a small extent by intakes of caffeine and phosphorus and to a greater extent by low status of vitamin D [9-11].

Dietary supplements Calcium is available in many dietary supplements, including multivitamin/mineral products and supplements containing calcium only or calcium plus vitamin D . Amounts of calcium in supplements vary widely; multivitamin/mineral supplements commonly contain about 200 to 300 mg, and common amounts in calcium or calcium plus vitamin D supplements are 500 or 600 mg . The two most common forms of calcium in supplements are calcium carbonate and calcium citrate . In people with low levels of stomach acid, the solubility rate of calcium carbonate is lower, which could reduce the absorption of calcium from calcium carbonate supplements unless they are taken with a meal . Calcium citrate is less dependent on stomach acid for absorption than calcium carbonate, so it can be taken without food . In general, however, absorption of calcium supplements is greater when they are taken with food, regardless of whether the user’s gastric acid is low . Other calcium forms in supplements include calcium sulfate, ascorbate, microcrystalline hydroxyapatite, gluconate, lactate, and phosphate . The forms of calcium in supplements contain varying amounts of elemental calcium. For example, calcium carbonate is 40% calcium by weight, whereas calcium citrate is 21% calcium . Elemental calcium is listed in the Supplement Facts panel, so consumers do not need to calculate the amount of calcium supplied by various forms of calcium in supplements. The percentage of calcium absorbed from supplements, as with that from foods, depends not only on the source of calcium but also on the total amount of elemental calcium consumed at one time; as the amount increases, the percentage absorbed decreases. Absorption from supplements is highest with doses of 500 mg or less . For example, the body absorbs about 36% of a 300 mg calcium dose and 28% of a 1,000 mg dose . Some individuals who take calcium supplements might experience gastrointestinal side effects, including gas, bloating, constipation, or a combination of these symptoms. Calcium carbonate appears to cause more of these side effects than calcium citrate, especially in older adults who have lower levels of stomach acid . Symptoms can be alleviated by switching to a supplement containing a different form of calcium, taking smaller calcium doses more often during the day, or taking the supplement with meals. Medicines Because of its ability to neutralize stomach acid, calcium carbonate is contained in some over-the-counter antacid products, such as Tums and Rolaids. Depending on its strength, each chewable pill or soft chew provides about 270 to 400 mg of calcium . Calcium Intakes and Status A substantial proportion of people in the United States consume less than recommended amounts of calcium. An analysis of 2007–2010 data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) found that 49% of children age 4–18 years and 39% of all individuals age 4 and older consume less than the EAR for calcium from foods and supplements . Average daily intakes of calcium from foods and beverages are 1,083 mg for men age 20 and older and 842 mg for women . For children age 2–19, mean daily intakes of calcium from foods and beverages range from 965 to 1,015 mg . Approximately 22% of men, 32% of women, and 4% to 8% of children take a dietary supplement containing calcium . Average daily calcium intakes from both foods and supplements are 1,156 mg for men, 1,009 mg for women, and 968 to 1,020 mg for children . According to 2009–2012 NHANES data, rates of calcium inadequacy (intakes below the EAR) are higher among non-Hispanic Blacks and non-Hispanic Asians (47%–48%) than among Hispanics (30%) and non-Hispanic Whites (24%) in the United States . Poverty is also associated with a higher risk of inadequacy. NHANES data from 2007 to 2014 show that the risk of inadequate calcium intakes (less than 800 to 1,100 mg) is 11.6% higher among adults age 50 and older in households earning less than $20,000 per year than other households . Calcium Deficiency Calcium deficiency can reduce bone strength and lead to osteoporosis, which is characterized by fragile bones and an increased risk of falling . Calcium deficiency can also cause rickets in children and other bone disorders in adults, although these disorders are more commonly caused by vitamin D deficiency. In children with rickets, the growth cartilage does not mineralize normally, which can lead to irreversible changes in the skeletal structure . Another effect of chronic calcium deficiency is osteomalacia, or defective bone mineralization and bone softening, which can occur in adults and children . For rickets and osteomalacia, the requirements for calcium and vitamin D appear to be interrelated in that the lower the serum vitamin D level (measured as 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]), the more calcium is needed to prevent these diseases . Hypocalcemia (serum calcium level less than 8.5 mg/dL [2.12 mmol/L] or an ionized calcium level below 4.61 mg/dL [1.15 mmol/L]) is usually a result of a vitamin D or magnesium deficiency, impaired parathyroid hormone production leading to hypoparathyroidism, impaired bone resorption of calcium, critical illness, or use of certain medications (e.g., bisphosphonates, cisplatin, or proton pump inhibitors) . Hypocalcemia can be asymptomatic, especially when it is mild or chronic . When signs and symptoms do occur, they can range widely because low serum calcium levels can affect most organs and symptoms . The most common symptom is increased neuromuscular irritability, including perioral numbness, tingling in the hands and feet, and muscle spasms . More severe signs and symptoms can include renal calcification or injury; brain calcification; neurologic symptoms (e.g., depression and bipolar disorder); cataracts; congestive heart failure; paresthesia; seizures; and, in rare cases, coma . Groups at Risk of Calcium Inadequacy The following groups are among those most likely to need extra calcium. Postmenopausal women Menopause leads to bone loss because decreases in estrogen production reduce calcium absorption and increase urinary calcium loss and calcium resorption from bone . On average, women lose approximately 1% of their bone mineral density (BMD) per year after menopause . Over time, these changes lead to decreased bone mass and fragile bones . About 30% of postmenopausal women in the United States and Europe have osteoporosis, and at least 40% of those with this condition develop at least one fragility fracture (a fracture that occurs after minor trauma, such as a fall from standing height or lower) . The calcium RDA is 1,200 mg for women older than 50 years (vs. 1,000 mg for younger women) to lessen bone loss after menopause . Individuals who avoid dairy products People with lactose intolerance, those with an allergy to milk, and those who avoid eating dairy products (including vegans) have a higher risk of inadequate calcium intakes because dairy products are rich sources of calcium . Options for increasing calcium intakes in individuals with lactose intolerance include consuming lactose-free or reduced-lactose dairy products, which contain the same amounts of calcium as regular dairy products . Those who avoid dairy products because of allergies or for other reasons can obtain calcium from nondairy sources, such as some vegetables (e.g., kale, broccoli, and Chinese cabbage [bok choi]), canned fish with bones, or fortified foods (e.g., fruit juices, breakfast cereals, and tofu) . However, these individuals typically need to eat foods fortified with calcium or take supplements to obtain recommended amounts . Calcium and Health This section focuses on six health conditions and diseases in which calcium might play a role: bone health in older adults, cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD), preeclampsia, weight management, and metabolic syndrome. Bone health in older adults Bone is constantly being remodeled. Declining levels of estrogen in women during menopause and for approximately 5 years afterward lead to rates of bone resorption that are higher than rates of bone formation, resulting in a rapid decrease in bone mass . Over time, postmenopausal women can develop osteoporosis, in which bone strength is compromised because of lower BMD and bone quality . Age-related bone loss can also occur in men and lead to osteoporosis, but fracture risk tends to increase in older men about 5 to 10 years later than in older women . Osteoporosis increases the risk of fractures, especially of the hip, vertebrae, and forearms . FDA has approved a health claim for the use of supplements containing calcium and vitamin D to reduce the risk of osteoporosis . However, not all research supports this claim. In spite of the importance of calcium in bone health, observational evidence is mixed on the link between calcium intakes and measures of bone strength in older adults. Support for such a link comes from an analysis of 2001–2006 NHANES cross-sectional data on 2,904 adults age 60 and older (54.6% women) showing an association between higher dietary calcium intakes and greater lumbar spine BMD, but only in women . In contrast, an analysis of baseline data from a randomized trial in Australia in 1,994 women older than 65 years whose average dietary calcium intake was 886 mg/day found no association between quintile of calcium intake and BMD at any site, even after adjustment for such factors as age, physical activity, height, and weight . Results were similar in 698 of the women who were followed for 6 years, even though mean daily intakes of calcium dropped by an average of 40 mg during this period. Some but not all clinical trials have found that calcium supplementation can improve bone health in older adults. A post-hoc analysis of data from a double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 1,000 mg elemental calcium in the form of calcium carbonate and 400 International Units (IU) (10 microgram [mcg]) vitamin D3 daily or placebo in 36,282 women age 50–79 years enrolled in the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) found that the supplementation did not prevent height loss after a mean follow-up period of 5.9 years . On average, women lost 1.28 mm/year of height in the supplementation group and 1.26 mm/year in the placebo group. However, a 2-year RCT in 500 healthy postmenopausal women showed that daily intakes of 500 ml/day skimmed milk enriched to provide 900 mg calcium and 15 mcg (600 IU) vitamin D led to increased BMD at the femoral neck . Several recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses have found that supplementation with calcium alone or a combination of calcium and vitamin D increases BMD in older adults. For example, a systematic review and meta-analysis included 15 RCTs in postmenopausal women (but did not include the two studies described in the previous paragraph) in 78,206 women, of which 37,412 were in the intervention group and 40,794 were in the control group . Supplementation with both calcium and vitamin D or consumption of dairy products fortified with both nutrients increased total BMD as well as BMD at the lumbar spine, arms, and femoral neck. However, in subgroup analyses, calcium had no effect on femoral neck BMD. Earlier systematic reviews and meta-analyses found a positive relationship between calcium and vitamin D supplementation and increased BMD in older males and between higher calcium intakes from dietary sources or supplements and higher BMD in adults older than 50 . However, whether these BMD increases were clinically significant is not clear. As with the evidence on the link between increased calcium intakes and reductions in BMD loss, the findings of research on the use of calcium supplementation to prevent fractures in older adults are mixed. For the most part, the observational evidence does not show that increasing calcium intakes reduces the risk of fractures and falls in older adults. For example, a longitudinal cohort study of 1,490 women age 42 to 52 years at baseline who were followed for 10–12 years found that fracture risk was not significantly different in calcium supplement users (some of whom also took vitamin D supplements) and nonusers, even though supplement use was associated with less BMD loss throughout the study period . Some clinical trial evidence shows that supplements containing a combination of calcium and vitamin D can reduce the risk of fractures in older adults. For example, a meta-analysis of 8 RCTs in 30,970 adults older than 50 years found that 500 to 1,200 mg/day calcium and 400 to 800 IU/day (10 to 20 mcg/day) vitamin D supplementation for 1 to 7 years reduced the risk of total fractures by 15% and hip fractures by 30% . However, findings were negative in another systematic review and meta-analysis that included 14 RCTs of calcium supplementation and 13 trials comparing calcium and vitamin D supplements with hormone therapy, placebo, or no treatment in participants older than 50 years . The results showed that calcium supplementation alone had no effect on risk of hip fracture, and supplementation with both calcium and vitamin D had no effect on risk of hip fracture, nonvertebral fracture, vertebral fracture, or total fracture. Similarly, a systematic review of 11 RCTs in 51,419 adults age 50 and older found that supplementation with vitamin D and calcium for 2 to 7 years had no impact on risk of total fractures or of hip fractures . The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concluded with moderate certainty that daily doses of less than 1,000 mg calcium and less than 400 IU (10 mcg) vitamin D do not prevent fractures in postmenopausal women and that the evidence on larger doses of this combination is inadequate to assess the benefits in this population . The USPSTF also determined the evidence on the benefits of calcium supplementation alone or with vitamin D to be inadequate to assess its effect on preventing fractures in men and premenopausal women. Additional research is needed before conclusions can be drawn about the use of calcium supplements to improve bone health and prevent fractures in older adults. Cancer Calcium might help reduce the risk of cancer, especially in the colon and rectum . However, evidence on the relationship between calcium intakes from foods or supplements and different forms of cancer is inconsistent . Most clinical trial evidence does not support a beneficial effect of calcium supplements on cancer incidence. A 4-year study of 1,500 mg calcium and 2,000 IU (50 mcg) vitamin D or placebo daily for 4 years in 2,303 healthy women age 55 years and older showed that supplementation did not reduce the risk of all types of cancer . The large WHI study described above also found no effect of supplemental calcium and vitamin D on cancer incidence during the 7-year trial and over a long-term median follow-up of 22.3 years . In addition, a meta-analysis of 10 RCTs that included 10,496 individuals who took supplements containing 500 mg calcium or more (without vitamin D) for a mean of 3.9 years found that calcium supplementation did not change the total cancer risk . However, one large clinical trial did find that calcium supplements reduce cancer risk. In this 4-year trial, by the same investigators as the 4-year trial above, 1,179 women age 55 years or older in Nebraska took 1,400 to 1,500 mg calcium alone; 1,400 to 1,500 mg calcium plus 1,100 IU (27.5 mcg) vitamin D3; or placebo daily. Cancer incidence from all causes was 60% lower in women who took the combination and 47% lower in those who took calcium-only supplements than in the placebo group . Some scientists have questioned these findings because of the lack of statistical power (the studies were designed to detect differences in bone health measures, not cancer incidence), details from the investigators on the study sample, and randomization procedures . Observational evidence does not support an association between higher calcium intakes and a lower risk of cancer mortality. An analysis of data on 132,823 participants in the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort, who were followed for an average of 17.5 years, found no association between total dietary and supplemental calcium intakes and risk of cancer-related death or death from lung, colorectal, breast, or prostate cancer in men or women . A systematic review and meta-analysis of 22 observational studies in 2,346,368 participants age 8 and older followed for 4.6 to 28 years also found no association between total dietary and supplemental calcium intake and cancer mortality . Results from many, but not all, clinical trials also suggest that supplemental calcium alone or combined with vitamin D does not affect risk of mortality from all cancers. An RCT in 5,292 adults age 70 years or older (85% women) in the United Kingdom compared the effects of 1,000 mg calcium, 8,000 IU (200 mcg) vitamin D3, both, or placebo for 24 to 62 months . Rates of cancer incidence and cancer mortality did not differ between those who did and those who did not receive calcium supplements. In the WHI trial, 36,282 postmenopausal women were randomly assigned to daily supplementation with a combination of 1,000 mg calcium and 400 IU (10 mcg) vitamin D3 or placebo . After an average of 7 years, risk of cancer mortality did not differ between groups. However, over a long-term median follow-up of 22.3 years, cancer mortality was 7% lower among women who received calcium and vitamin D supplements compared with those who received placebo . The meta-analysis described above of 10 RCTs that administered calcium alone and that included 10,496 individuals found no impact of calcium supplementation on cancer mortality rates . A substantial body of evidence has addressed the role of calcium in preventing colorectal cancer or its precursor, adenomas. Much but not all of the observational evidence supports a link between higher calcium intakes and lower risk of colorectal cancer. A cohort study in 77,712 adults found that over a mean of 7.8 years, the highest total intake of dietary and supplemental calcium (median of 1,999 mg/day) was associated with a 26% lower risk of colon cancer than the lowest quintile (587 mg/day) but had no association with risk of rectal cancer . In a dose-response meta-analysis of 15 prospective cohort studies in 1,415,597 participants (mean total dietary and supplemental calcium intake 250 to 1,900 mg/day) followed for 3.3 to 16 years, risk of colorectal cancer dropped by 8% with each 300 mg/day increase in total calcium intake . Findings were similar for dietary intakes of calcium in two other meta-analyses . In spite of the observational evidence supporting an association between higher calcium intakes and lower colorectal cancer risk, clinical trials investigating calcium supplements for prevention of colorectal cancer or adenomas have had mixed results. A 2013 follow-up study by Cauley and colleagues evaluated outcomes 4.9 years after completion of the 7-year WHI trial of 1,000 mg/day calcium plus 400 IU (10 mcg)/day vitamin D3 or placebo in 36,282 postmenopausal women . Colorectal cancer rates did not differ between groups. Similarly, in a follow-up study an average of 55 months after administration of 1,200 mg/day calcium, 1,000 IU (25 mcg)/day vitamin D3, or both for 3 to 5 years in 1,121 participants, supplements had no effect on risk of recurrent adenomas . However, a systematic review and meta-analysis of four RCTs (not including the 2013 study by Cauley and colleagues) found that daily supplementation with 1,200 to 2,000 mg elemental calcium for 36 to 60 months reduced the likelihood of recurrent adenomas by 11%, although the supplements had no effect on risk of advanced adenomas . Several observational studies have shown that the risk of prostate cancer might be higher with higher calcium intakes, but possibly only when the calcium comes from dairy foods. In an analysis of data from 2,776 men who participated in the French SU.VI.MAX (Supplementation en Vitamines et Minéraux Antioxydants) prospective study and were followed for an average of 7.7 years, prostate cancer risk was higher with higher calcium intakes . The risk was 2.4 times higher in men in the highest quartile of intake (more than 1,081 mg/day) than those with the lowest quartile (less than 725 mg/day). However, in analyses of results for various sources of calcium, only calcium from dairy foods was significantly associated with prostate cancer risk (2.9 times higher in men with intakes greater than 696 mg/day than in those with intakes less than 354 mg/day); calcium intakes from nondairy sources were not significantly associated with prostate cancer risk. In a systematic review and meta-analysis of nine cohort studies in 750,275 men, the risk of prostate cancer was 2% higher for each 400 mg/day increment in total dietary and supplemental calcium intake, but nondairy and supplemental calcium intakes were not associated with prostate cancer risk . A meta-analysis included 15 epidemiological studies of calcium intake and ovarian cancer risk in 493,415 women who developed 7,453 cases of ovarian cancer . In this meta-analysis, ovarian cancer risk was 20% lower in participants in the highest category of dietary calcium intakes (more than 820–1,500 mg/day, depending on the study) than the lowest intake category (less than 362–800 mg/day, depending on the study). However, the difference in risk was not statistically significant when both dietary and supplemental calcium intakes were considered. For breast cancer, observational studies have had mixed findings on whether higher calcium intakes are associated with a lower risk. A meta-analysis of 11 prospective cohort studies in 872,895 women who developed 26,606 cases of breast cancer over 7 to 25 years found that women with the highest calcium intakes had an 8% lower risk of breast cancer . However, the WHI (described above) found similar incidence rates of invasive breast cancer in the supplement and placebo groups . Additional well-designed randomized trials are needed to determine whether dietary or supplemental calcium intakes increase, decrease, or have no effect on risk of cancer in general or of specific types of cancer, or on cancer mortality. Cardiovascular disease Calcium binds fatty acids, so it can reduce lipid absorption and might therefore lower CVD risk . However, the findings from research on the role of dietary calcium and calcium supplements in reducing CVD have been mixed, and some evidence indicates that calcium supplements might even increase CVD risk. Several large observational studies have shown an association between lower calcium intakes and higher risk of hypertension, stroke, and atherosclerosis. For example, an analysis of 1999–2010 NHANES data from 14,408 adults (mean age 54 years) with obesity found that calcium intakes were 10% lower in adults with obesity and hypertension than in those without hypertension . This association was strongest in women, adults age 20–44 years, those who did not have diabetes, and especially women age 20–44 years. A prospective cohort study that followed 41,514 adults age 40 to 69 years in Australia for 13 years found a 25% lower rate of stroke in adults in the highest calcium intake quartile (mean of 1,076 mg/day) than in the lowest quartile (mean of 641 mg/day) . However, the study found no association between calcium intakes and risk of CVD mortality or myocardial infarction. The risk of atherosclerosis over 10 years in a study of 5,448 adults age 45–84 years was 27% lower in the highest quintile of calcium intake (mean of 2,157 mg/day) than in the lowest quintile (mean of 313 mg/day) . Furthermore, a systematic review and meta-analysis that included 27 observational studies found no consistent dose-response relationships between total, dietary, or supplemental calcium intakes and CVD mortality . Evidence on dose-response relationships between calcium intakes and risk of stroke or stroke mortality was inconsistent. A diet containing more calcium than the typical U.S. diet because of added low-fat or nonfat dairy products lowered systolic blood pressure by an average of 5.5 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 3.0 mmHg . However, this Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet also increases intakes of other nutrients, such as potassium and magnesium, that are associated with reductions in blood pressure, so any independent contribution of calcium cannot be determined. Some clinical trials have shown that calcium supplements are associated with decreased hypertension risk or decreased cholesterol levels, but others have had more mixed findings. A Cochrane Review of 16 trials in 3,048 adults with a median follow-up period of 3.5 months found that calcium supplementation (typically 1,000 to 2,000 mg/day) reduced systolic blood pressure by 1.43 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 0.98 mmHg . Effects were greatest in adults younger than 35 years and with doses higher than 1,500 mg/day calcium. A meta-analysis of 23 RCTs in 4,071 participants showed that calcium supplements providing 162 to 2,000 mg/day (combined with vitamin D in 10 RCTs) for 2 weeks to 5 years was associated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels that were 4.6 mg/dL lower and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels that were 1.9 mg/dL higher . Findings were mixed in two analyses of data from the WHI. One analysis of results from 35,983 women age 50 to 79 years randomly assigned to 1,000 mg/day calcium and 400 IU (10 mcg)/day vitamin D supplements or placebo for 10 years found no reduction in risk of heart failure . However, the calcium and vitamin D supplements were associated with 5% lower heart failure risk in participants who had no pre-existing heart failure risk factors (coronary heart disease, diabetes, or hypertension). In another secondary analysis of data on 16,801 WHI participants, the supplements had no association with atrial fibrillation risk . An analysis of long-term health outcomes from the WHI over a median follow-up of 22.3 years found no effect of calcium and vitamin D supplements on cardiovascular disease risk . Similarly, an evidence report and systematic review conducted for the USPSTF that included 11 RCTs of vitamin D, calcium, or both for 2 to 7 years in 51,419 adults age 50 years and older found that supplementation with vitamin D alone or combined with calcium had no effect on CVD incidence . In contrast, several prospective cohort studies and RCTs have shown that calcium supplements increase the risk of CVD. A meta-analysis of 14 RCTs (including one study that administered supplements providing 20 mcg [800 IU] vitamin D per day) in 28,935 healthy postmenopausal women found that calcium supplements providing 500 to 2,000 mg/day calcium for 1 to 7 years increased CVD risk by 15% and coronary heart disease risk by 16% . In addition, when 132,823 adults (mean age 63 years) were followed for an average of 17.5 years, the risk of CVD mortality was 22% higher in men with calcium supplement intakes of 1,000 mg/day or more than in those not taking calcium supplements . However, in women, the CVD mortality rate was 16% lower with supplemental calcium intakes of 1,000 mg/day than with no supplemental calcium intakes. An analysis of long-term health outcomes from the WHI over a median follow-up of 22.3 years found that women who received calcium and vitamin D supplements had a 6% higher risk of death from cardiovascular disease than those who received placebo . Other studies have found no association between calcium supplements and CVD risk or CVD outcomes. After 24 years of follow-up of 74,245 women age 30 to 55 years at baseline who participated in the Nurses’ Health Study, women taking more than 1,000 mg/day calcium supplements did not have a higher risk of CVD than those taking no supplemental calcium . An expert panel convened by the National Osteoporosis Foundation and American Society for Preventive Cardiology determined, on the basis of moderate-quality evidence, that calcium intakes with or without vitamin D from foods or supplements neither increase nor decrease the risk of CVD or CVD mortality . The societies therefore concluded that calcium intakes that do not exceed the UL are safe \"from a cardiovascular standpoint.\" Preeclampsia Preeclampsia is defined as hypertension and proteinuria or thrombocytopenia during pregnancy, usually after 20 weeks’ gestation . It is a leading cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality that affects about 4% of pregnancies in the United States . Calcium supplementation during pregnancy might reduce the risk of preeclampsia, but the benefits might apply only to women with inadequate calcium intakes, and much of this evidence comes from studies with methodological weaknesses . A Cochrane Review included 27 RCTs of calcium supplements during pregnancy in 18,064 women to prevent hypertensive disorders and related problems . In the 13 studies—none of which administered vitamin D supplements—that evaluated high doses (at least 1,000 mg/day calcium) in 15,730 women, supplementation reduced the risk of high blood pressure by 35% and, in women with low dietary calcium intakes (less than 900 mg/day; 8 trials in 10,678 women), the risk of preeclampsia by 64%. However, the quality of this evidence was low. In 12 trials in 2,334 women, doses of less than 1,000 mg/day (usually 500 mg/day) reduced the risk of high blood pressure by 47% and of preeclampsia by 62%. However, most of these studies recruited women at high risk of preeclampsia and had a high risk of bias. An earlier systematic review and meta-analysis of 10 RCTs in 24,787 women also found that calcium supplementation (1,500 to 2,000 mg/day) reduced the risk of preeclampsia by 38% and, in women at increased risk of any hypertensive disorder of pregnancy, by 64% . However, when the analysis was restricted to trials with 4,000 or more women, the effect was no longer statistically significant. An RCT in 1,355 women in Argentina, South Africa, and Zimbabwe also found that 500 mg/day calcium supplementation starting before conception made no difference in the risk of preeclampsia . Several professional organizations recommend calcium supplements during pregnancy for women with low calcium intakes to reduce the risk of preeclampsia. For example, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology states that daily supplementation with 1,500–2,000 mg calcium might reduce the severity of preeclampsia in pregnant women who have calcium intakes of less than 600 mg/day . The World Health Organization recommends 1,500–2,000 mg/day calcium for pregnant women with low dietary calcium intakes to reduce preeclampsia risk . The Canadian Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy Working Group , the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy , and the Society of Obstetric Medicine of Australia and New Zealand have similar recommendations. Weight management Observational and clinical trial evidence linking higher calcium intakes from dairy products or supplements to lower body weight or less weight gain over time is mixed. An observational study found an association between higher calcium intakes and lower prevalence of overweight or obesity in 6,696 children (51% male, mean age 6 years) in eight European countries, of whom 2,744 were re-examined 6 years later . The prevalence of overweight or obesity at 6-year follow-up was lower in boys (16%) and girls (18%) in the highest tertile of calcium intake (664 mg/1,000 kcal for boys and 667 mg/1,000 kcal for girls) than in boys (26%) and girls (25%) in the lowest tertile (249 mg/1,000 kcal for both boys and girls). In contrast, a longitudinal study in 2,159 participants in Portugal evaluated at ages 13 and 21 years found no association between total dietary and supplemental calcium intake at age 13 and body mass index (BMI) at age 21 after the analysis was adjusted for energy intake . The study also found no associations between consumption of dairy foods (milk, yogurt, and cheese) at age 13 and BMI at age 21. Clinical trials and meta-analyses of RCTs assessing the impact of calcium supplements or increased intakes of calcium from dairy products on prevention of weight gain or promotion of fat loss or weight loss have had mixed results [89-93]. For example, postmenopausal women who took 1,000 mg calcium and 400 IU (10 mcg) vitamin D daily for 3 years in the WHI whose daily intakes were less than 1,200 mg calcium at baseline were 11% less likely to gain 1 kg of weight or more than those who took placebo during this period . A systematic review and meta-analysis of 41 RCTs that examined the effect of dairy foods or calcium supplements (at least 300 mg/day) in 4,802 adults found that higher calcium intakes from dairy foods had no impact on body weight or body fat, although they did reduce body fat when combined with an energy-restricted diet . In addition, calcium supplements had no effect on body weight or body fat. For additional information on calcium and weight management, see the health professional fact sheet on weight loss. Metabolic syndrome Metabolic syndrome is a set of at least three risk factors for heart disease, stroke, and diabetes—large waistline, high triglyceride level, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, high blood pressure, and high fasting blood sugar level. Some observational evidence links higher calcium intakes with lower risk of metabolic syndrome. An analysis of 2001–2010 NHANES data on 9,148 adults found that women in the highest quintile (at least 1,172 mg/day) of calcium intake, based on 24-hour recall, had a 27% lower risk of metabolic syndrome than those in the lowest quintile (less than 547 mg/day) . Furthermore, women who met the RDA for calcium for adults (1,000 to 1,200 mg/day, depending on age) had an 18% lower risk of metabolic syndrome, but the association was not statistically significant in men who met the RDA for calcium. In a meta-analysis of eight cross-sectional studies and two prospective cohort studies in 63,017 participants age 20 years and older, 14,906 participants developed metabolic syndrome . For each 300 mg/day increase in dietary calcium intake, risk of metabolic syndrome dropped by 7%. Subgroup analyses suggested that the inverse association between dietary calcium intakes and metabolic syndrome risk was stronger in women than men. Clinical trial evidence on the link between calcium and metabolic syndrome is very limited. In one placebo-controlled clinical trial in Iran in 66 adults who were overweight and had type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease, supplements of 5 mcg (200 IU) vitamin D, 90 mcg vitamin K, and 500 mg calcium for 12 weeks significantly reduced maximum levels of left carotid intima media thickness and improved metabolic status (including improvements in insulin resistance, insulin concentrations, beta-cell function, and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index) . More evidence, including from well-designed clinical trials, is needed to determine whether higher intakes of calcium can reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome. Health Risks from Excessive Calcium Hypercalcemia (serum levels greater than 10.5 mg/dL [2.63 mmol/L]) and hypercalciuria (urinary calcium levels higher than 250 mg/day in women and 275 mg/day in men) are rare in healthy people and usually result from cancer, primary hyperparathyroidism, and other conditions . Hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria can cause poor muscle tone, renal insufficiency, hypophosphatemia, constipation, nausea, weight loss, fatigue, polyuria, heart arrhythmias, and a higher risk of CVD mortality . High calcium intakes might also increase the risk of CVD (see section on CVD in Calcium and Health section above) and prostate cancer (see Other Cancers in Calcium and Health section above for more details) , although not all studies confirm these findings. The ULs for calcium established by the FNB are listed in Table 3. They are based on observational evidence from the WHI showing a link between higher intakes of supplemental calcium (1,000 mg/day for 7 years) and a greater risk of kidney stones . However, two subsequent systematic reviews of the evidence from 10 studies in more than 8,000 adults with osteoporosis who took 120 to 1,500 mg supplemental calcium daily for 3 days to 3 years and 11 RCTs in 51,419 adults 50 years and older who took 1,000 to 1,600 mg calcium with or without vitamin D for 2 to 7 years found no such association. Table 3: Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for Calcium 0–6 months: Male: 1,000 mg, Female: 1,000 mg, Pregnant: , Lactating:  7–12 months: Male: 1,500 mg, Female: 1,500 mg, Pregnant: , Lactating:  1–8 years: Male: 2,500 mg, Female: 2,500 mg, Pregnant: , Lactating:  9–18 years: Male: 3,000 mg, Female: 3,000 mg, Pregnant: 3,000 mg, Lactating: 3,000 mg 19–50 years: Male: 2,500 mg, Female: 2,500 mg, Pregnant: 2,500 mg, Lactating: 2,500 mg 51+ years: Male: 2,000 mg, Female: 2,000 mg, Pregnant: , Lactating:  Interactions with Medications Calcium has the potential to interact with certain medications, and several types of medications might adversely affect calcium levels. A few examples are provided below. Individuals taking these and other medications on a regular basis should discuss their calcium status with their health care providers. Dolutegravir Dolutegravir (Dovato, Tivicay) is an HIV integrase inhibitor used in adults and children. Concomitant use of calcium supplements and dolutegravir can reduce blood levels of dolutegravir substantially, apparently through chelation . The labels approved by the FDA for dolutegravir advise patients to take dolutegravir 2 hours before or 6 hours after taking calcium supplements . Levothyroxine Calcium carbonate supplements can interfere with the absorption of levothyroxine (Synthroid, Levoxyl, and others), a thyroid hormone used to treat hypothyroidism and thyroid cancer [104-106]. The FDA-approved label for this medication instructs patients taking calcium carbonate supplements to avoid taking levothyroxine within 4 hours of taking the supplement . Lithium Long-term use of lithium (Eskalith, Lithobid), a treatment for bipolar disorder, can lead to hypercalcemia, and use of both lithium and calcium supplements could increase this risk . Quinolone antibiotics Simultaneous use of calcium supplements and quinolone antibiotics—such as ciprofloxacin (Cipro), gemifloxacin (Factive), and moxifloxacin (Avelox)—can reduce the absorption of quinolones . Taking the antibiotic 2 hours before or 2 hours after calcium supplements prevents this effect . Calcium and Healthful Diets The federal government’s 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy). For more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy eating pattern as one that Includes a variety of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fat-free or low-fat milk and milk products, and oils. Many dairy products, such as milk, cheese, and yogurt, are rich sources of calcium. Some vegetables provide significant amounts of calcium, as do some fortified cereals and juices. Includes a variety of protein foods, including seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs, legumes (beans and peas), nuts, seeds, and soy products.

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet. Introduction Magnesium, an abundant mineral in the body, is naturally present in many foods, added to other food products, available as a dietary supplement, and present in some medicines (such as antacids and laxatives). Magnesium is a cofactor in more than 300 enzyme systems that regulate diverse biochemical reactions in the body, including protein synthesis, muscle and nerve function, blood glucose control, and blood pressure regulation [1-3]. Magnesium is required for energy production, oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolysis. It contributes to the structural development of bone and is required for the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and the antioxidant glutathione. Magnesium also plays a role in the active transport of calcium and potassium ions across cell membranes, a process that is important to nerve impulse conduction, muscle contraction, and normal heart rhythm . An adult body contains approximately 25 g magnesium, with 50% to 60% present in the bones and most of the rest in soft tissues . Less than 1% of total magnesium is in blood serum, and these levels are kept under tight control. Normal serum magnesium concentrations range between 0.75 and 0.95 millimoles (mmol)/L . Hypomagnesemia is defined as a serum magnesium level less than 0.75 mmol/L . Magnesium homeostasis is largely controlled by the kidney, which typically excretes about 120 mg magnesium into the urine each day . Urinary excretion is reduced when magnesium status is low . Assessing magnesium status is difficult because most magnesium is inside cells or in bone . The most commonly used and readily available method for assessing magnesium status is measurement of serum magnesium concentration, even though serum levels have little correlation with total body magnesium levels or concentrations in specific tissues . Other methods for assessing magnesium status include measuring magnesium concentrations in erythrocytes, saliva, and urine; measuring ionized magnesium concentrations in blood, plasma, or serum; and conducting a magnesium-loading (or tolerance) test. No single method is considered satisfactory . Some experts but not others consider the tolerance test (in which urinary magnesium is measured after parenteral infusion of a dose of magnesium) to be the best method to assess magnesium status in adults. To comprehensively evaluate magnesium status, both laboratory tests and a clinical assessment might be required . Recommended Intakes Intake recommendations for magnesium and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies (formerly National Academy of Sciences) . DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used to plan and assess nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following: Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects Table 1 lists the current RDAs for magnesium . For infants from birth to 12 months, the FNB established an AI for magnesium that is equivalent to the mean intake of magnesium in healthy, breastfed infants, with added solid foods for ages 7–12 months. Table 1: Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for Magnesium Birth to 6 months: Male: 30 mg*, Female: 30 mg*, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  7–12 months: Male: 75 mg*, Female: 75 mg*, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  1–3 years: Male: 80 mg, Female: 80 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  4–8 years: Male: 130 mg, Female: 130 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  9–13 years: Male: 240 mg, Female: 240 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  14–18 years: Male: 410 mg, Female: 360 mg, Pregnancy: 400 mg, Lactation: 360 mg 19–30 years: Male: 400 mg, Female: 310 mg, Pregnancy: 350 mg, Lactation: 310 mg 31–50 years: Male: 420 mg, Female: 320 mg, Pregnancy: 360 mg, Lactation: 320 mg 51+ years: Male: 420 mg, Female: 320 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  *Adequate Intake (AI) Sources of Magnesium Food Magnesium is widely distributed in plant and animal foods and in beverages. Green leafy vegetables, such as spinach, legumes, nuts, seeds, and whole grains, are good sources . In general, foods containing dietary fiber provide magnesium. Magnesium is also added to some breakfast cereals and other fortified foods. Some types of food processing, such as refining grains in ways that remove the nutrient-rich germ and bran, lower magnesium content substantially . Selected food sources of magnesium are listed in Table 2. Tap, mineral, and bottled waters can also be sources of magnesium, but the amount of magnesium in water varies by source and brand (ranging from 1 mg/L to more than 120 mg/L) . Approximately 30% to 40% of the dietary magnesium consumed is typically absorbed by the body .

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for magnesium is 420 mg for adults and children age 4 years and older . FDA does not require food labels to list magnesium content unless magnesium has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) FoodData Central lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides comprehensive list of foods containing magnesium arranged by nutrient content and by food name. Dietary supplements Magnesium supplements are available in a variety of forms, including magnesium oxide, citrate, and chloride . The Supplement Facts panel on a dietary supplement label declares the amount of elemental magnesium in the product, not the weight of the entire magnesium-containing compound. Absorption of magnesium from different kinds of magnesium supplements varies. Forms of magnesium that dissolve well in liquid are more completely absorbed in the gut than less soluble forms . Small studies have found that magnesium in the aspartate, citrate, lactate, and chloride forms is absorbed more completely and is more bioavailable than magnesium oxide and magnesium sulfate [12-16]. One study found that very high doses of zinc from supplements (142 mg/day) can interfere with magnesium absorption and disrupt the magnesium balance in the body . Medicines Magnesium is a primary ingredient in some laxatives . Phillips' Milk of Magnesia, for example, provides 500 mg elemental magnesium (as magnesium hydroxide) per tablespoon; the directions advise taking up to 4 tablespoons/day for adolescents and adults . (Although such a dose of magnesium is well above the safe upper level, some of the magnesium is not absorbed because of the medication's laxative effect.) Magnesium is also included in some remedies for heartburn and upset stomach due to acid indigestion . Extra-strength Rolaids, for example, provides 55 mg elemental magnesium (as magnesium hydroxide) per tablet , although Tums is magnesium free . Magnesium Intakes and Status Dietary surveys of people in the United States consistently show that many people consume less than recommended amounts of magnesium. An analysis of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) of 2013–2016 found that 48% of Americans of all ages ingest less magnesium from food and beverages than their respective EARs; adult men age 71 years and older and adolescent males and females are most likely to have low intakes . In a study using data from NHANES 2003–2006 to assess mineral intakes among adults, average intakes of magnesium from food alone were higher among users of dietary supplements (350 mg for men and 267 mg for women, equal to or slightly exceeding their respective EARs) than among nonusers (268 mg for men and 234 for women) . When supplements were included, average total intakes of magnesium were 449 mg for men and 387 mg for women, well above EAR levels. No current data on magnesium status in the United States are available. Determining dietary intake of magnesium is the usual proxy for assessing magnesium status. NHANES has not determined serum magnesium levels in its participants since 1974 , and magnesium is not evaluated in routine electrolyte testing in hospitals and clinics . Magnesium Deficiency Symptomatic magnesium deficiency due to low dietary intake in otherwise-healthy people is uncommon because the kidneys limit urinary excretion of this mineral . However, habitually low intakes or excessive losses of magnesium due to certain health conditions, chronic alcoholism, and/or the use of certain medications can lead to magnesium deficiency. Early signs of magnesium deficiency include loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and weakness. As magnesium deficiency worsens, numbness, tingling, muscle contractions and cramps, seizures, personality changes, abnormal heart rhythms, and coronary spasms can occur . Severe magnesium deficiency can result in hypocalcemia or hypokalemia (low serum calcium or potassium levels, respectively) because mineral homeostasis is disrupted . Groups at Risk of Magnesium Inadequacy Magnesium inadequacy can occur when intakes fall below the RDA but are above the amount required to prevent overt deficiency. The following groups are more likely than others to be at risk of magnesium inadequacy because they typically consume insufficient amounts or they have medical conditions (or take medications) that reduce magnesium absorption from the gut or increase losses from the body. People with gastrointestinal diseases The chronic diarrhea and fat malabsorption resulting from Crohn's disease, gluten-sensitive enteropathy (celiac disease), and regional enteritis can lead to magnesium depletion over time . Resection or bypass of the small intestine, especially the ileum, typically leads to malabsorption and magnesium loss . People with type 2 diabetes Magnesium deficits and increased urinary magnesium excretion can occur in people with insulin resistance and/or type 2 diabetes . The magnesium loss appears to be secondary to higher concentrations of glucose in the kidney that increase urine output . People with alcohol dependence Magnesium deficiency is common in people with chronic alcoholism . In these individuals, poor dietary intake and nutritional status; gastrointestinal problems, including vomiting, diarrhea, and steatorrhea (fatty stools) resulting from pancreatitis; renal dysfunction with excess excretion of magnesium into the urine; phosphate depletion; vitamin D deficiency; acute alcoholic ketoacidosis; and hyperaldosteronism secondary to liver disease can all contribute to decreased magnesium status . Older adults Older adults have lower dietary intakes of magnesium than younger adults . In addition, magnesium absorption from the gut decreases and renal magnesium excretion increases with age . Older adults are also more likely to have chronic diseases or take medications that alter magnesium status, which can increase their risk of magnesium depletion . Magnesium and Health Habitually low intakes of magnesium induce changes in biochemical pathways that can increase the risk of illness over time. This section focuses on four diseases and disorders in which magnesium might be involved: hypertension and cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, and migraine headaches. Hypertension and cardiovascular disease Hypertension is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke. Studies to date, however, have found that magnesium supplementation lowers blood pressure, at best, to only a small extent. A meta-analysis of 12 clinical trials found that magnesium supplementation for 8–26 weeks in 545 hypertensive participants resulted in only a small reduction (2.2 mmHg) in diastolic blood pressure . The dose of magnesium ranged from approximately 243 to 973 mg/day. The authors of another meta-analysis of 22 studies with 1,173 normotensive and hypertensive adults concluded that magnesium supplementation for 3–24 weeks decreased systolic blood pressure by 3–4 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 2–3 mmHg . The effects were somewhat larger when supplemental magnesium intakes of the participants in the nine crossover-design trials exceeded 370 mg/day. A diet containing more magnesium because of added fruits and vegetables, more low-fat or nonfat dairy products, and less fat overall was shown to lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure by an average of 5.5 and 3.0 mmHg, respectively . However, this Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet also increases intakes of other nutrients, such as potassium and calcium, that are associated with reductions in blood pressure, so any independent contribution of magnesium cannot be determined. In 2022, FDA approved a qualified health claim for conventional foods and dietary supplements that contain magnesium . One example of this claim states, “Consuming diets with adequate magnesium may reduce the risk of high blood pressure (hypertension). However, FDA has concluded that the evidence is inconsistent and inconclusive.” FDA also specifies that foods and dietary supplements carrying this claim on their labels must provide at least 84 mg of magnesium per serving and, for dietary supplements, no more than 350 mg. Several prospective studies have examined associations between magnesium intakes and heart disease. The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study assessed heart disease risk factors and levels of serum magnesium in a cohort of 14,232 White and African-American men and women age 45 to 64 years at baseline . Over an average of 12 years of follow-up, individuals in the highest quartile of the normal physiologic range of serum magnesium (at least 0.88 mmol/L) had a 38% reduced risk of sudden cardiac death compared with individuals in the lowest quartile (0.75 mmol/L or less). However, dietary magnesium intakes had no association with risk of sudden cardiac death. Another prospective study tracked 88,375 female nurses in the United States to determine whether serum magnesium levels measured early in the study and magnesium intakes from food and supplements assessed every 2 to 4 years were associated with sudden cardiac death over 26 years of follow-up . Women in the highest compared with the lowest quartile of ingested and plasma magnesium concentrations had a 34% and 77% lower risk of sudden cardiac death, respectively. Another prospective population study of 7,664 adults age 20 to 75 years in the Netherlands who did not have cardiovascular disease found that low urinary magnesium excretion levels (a marker for low dietary magnesium intake) were associated with a higher risk of ischemic heart disease over a median follow-up period of 10.5 years. Plasma magnesium concentrations were not associated with risk of ischemic heart disease . A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies found that higher serum levels of magnesium were significantly associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, and higher dietary magnesium intakes (up to approximately 250 mg/day) were associated with a significantly lower risk of ischemic heart disease caused by a reduced blood supply to the heart muscle . Higher magnesium intakes might reduce the risk of stroke. In a meta-analysis of seven prospective trials with a total of 241,378 participants, an additional 100 mg/day magnesium in the diet was associated with an 8% decreased risk of total stroke, especially ischemic rather than hemorrhagic stroke . One limitation of such observational studies, however, is the possibility of confounding with other nutrients or dietary components that could also affect the risk of stroke. A large, well-designed clinical trial is needed to better understand the contributions of magnesium from food and dietary supplements to heart health and the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease . Type 2 diabetes Diets with higher amounts of magnesium are associated with a significantly lower risk of diabetes, possibly because of the important role of magnesium in glucose metabolism . Hypomagnesemia might worsen insulin resistance, a condition that often precedes diabetes, or it might be a consequence of insulin resistance . Diabetes leads to increased urinary losses of magnesium, and the subsequent magnesium inadequacy might impair insulin secretion and action, thereby worsening diabetes control . Most investigations of magnesium intake and risk of type 2 diabetes have been prospective cohort studies. A meta-analysis of seven of these studies, which included 286,668 patients and 10,912 cases of diabetes over 6 to 17 years of follow-up, found that a 100 mg/day increase in total magnesium intake decreased the risk of diabetes by a statistically significant 15% . Another meta-analysis of eight prospective cohort studies that followed 271,869 men and women over 4 to 18 years found a significant inverse association between magnesium intake from food and risk of type 2 diabetes; the relative risk reduction was 23% when the highest to lowest intakes were compared . A 2011 meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies of the association between magnesium intake and risk of type 2 diabetes included 13 studies with a total of 536,318 participants and 24,516 cases of diabetes . The mean length of follow-up ranged from 4 to 20 years. Investigators found an inverse association between magnesium intake and risk of type 2 diabetes in a dose-responsive fashion, but this association achieved statistical significance only in individuals who were overweight (body mass index [BMI] 25 or higher) but not in normal-weight individuals (BMI less than 25). Again, a limitation of these observational studies is the possibility of confounding with other dietary components or lifestyle or environmental variables that are correlated with magnesium intake. Only a few small, short-term clinical trials have examined the potential effects of supplemental magnesium on control of type 2 diabetes and the results are conflicting . For example, 128 patients with poorly controlled diabetes in a Brazilian clinical trial received a placebo or a supplement containing either 500 mg/day or 1,000 mg/day magnesium oxide (providing 300 or 600 mg elemental magnesium, respectively) . After 30 days of supplementation, plasma, cellular, and urine magnesium levels increased in participants receiving the larger dose of the supplement, and their glycemic control improved. In another small trial in Mexico, participants with type 2 diabetes and hypomagnesemia who received a liquid supplement of magnesium chloride (providing 300 mg/day elemental magnesium) for 16 weeks showed significant reductions in fasting glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin concentrations compared with participants receiving a placebo, and their serum magnesium levels became normal . In contrast, neither a supplement of magnesium aspartate (providing 369 mg/day elemental magnesium) nor a placebo taken for 3 months had any effect on glycemic control in 50 patients with type 2 diabetes who were taking insulin . The American Diabetes Association states that there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of magnesium to improve glycemic control in people with diabetes . It further notes that there is no clear scientific evidence that vitamin and mineral supplementation benefits people with diabetes who do not have underlying nutritional deficiencies. Osteoporosis Magnesium is involved in bone formation and influences the activities of osteoblasts and osteoclasts . Magnesium also affects the concentrations of both parathyroid hormone and the active form of vitamin D, which are major regulators of bone homeostasis. Several population-based studies have found positive associations between magnesium intake and bone mineral density in both men and women . Other research has found that women with osteoporosis have lower serum magnesium levels than women with osteopenia and those who do not have osteoporosis or osteopenia . These and other findings indicate that magnesium deficiency might be a risk factor for osteoporosis . Although limited in number, studies suggest that increasing magnesium intakes from food or supplements might increase bone mineral density in postmenopausal and elderly women . For example, one short-term study found that 290 mg/day elemental magnesium (as magnesium citrate) for 30 days in 20 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis suppressed bone turnover compared with placebo, suggesting that bone loss decreased . Diets that provide recommended levels of magnesium enhance bone health, but further research is needed to elucidate the role of magnesium in the prevention and management of osteoporosis. Migraine headaches Magnesium deficiency is related to factors that promote headaches, including neurotransmitter release and vasoconstriction . People who experience migraine headaches have lower levels of serum and tissue magnesium than those who do not. However, research on the use of magnesium supplements to prevent or reduce symptoms of migraine headaches is limited. Three of four small, short-term, placebo-controlled trials found modest reductions in the frequency of migraines in patients given up to 600 mg/day magnesium . The authors of a review on migraine prophylaxis suggested that taking 300 mg magnesium twice a day, either alone or in combination with medication, can prevent migraines . In their evidence-based guideline update, the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society concluded that magnesium therapy is probably effective for migraine prevention . Because the typical dose of magnesium used for migraine prevention exceeds the UL, this treatment should be used only under the direction and supervision of a health care provider. Health Risks from Excessive Magnesium Too much magnesium from food does not pose a health risk in healthy individuals because the kidneys eliminate excess amounts in the urine . However, high doses of magnesium from dietary supplements or medications often result in diarrhea that can be accompanied by nausea and abdominal cramping . Forms of magnesium most commonly reported to cause diarrhea include magnesium carbonate, chloride, gluconate, and oxide . The diarrhea and laxative effects of magnesium salts are due to the osmotic activity of unabsorbed salts in the intestine and colon and the stimulation of gastric motility . Very large doses of magnesium-containing laxatives and antacids (typically providing more than 5,000 mg/day magnesium) have been associated with magnesium toxicity , including fatal hypermagnesemia in a 28-month-old boy and an elderly man . Symptoms of magnesium toxicity, which usually develop after serum concentrations exceed 1.74–2.61 mmol/L, can include hypotension, nausea, vomiting, facial flushing, retention of urine, ileus, depression, and lethargy before progressing to muscle weakness, difficulty breathing, extreme hypotension, irregular heartbeat, and cardiac arrest . The risk of magnesium toxicity increases with impaired renal function or kidney failure because the ability to remove excess magnesium is reduced or lost . The FNB has established ULs for supplemental magnesium for healthy infants, children, and adults (see Table 3) . For many age groups, the UL appears to be lower than the RDA. This occurs because the RDAs include magnesium from all sources—food, beverages, dietary supplements, and medications. The ULs include magnesium from only dietary supplements and medications; they do not include magnesium found naturally in food and beverages. Table 3: Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for Supplemental Magnesium Birth to 12 months: Male: None established, Female: None established, Pregnant: , Lactating:  1–3 years: Male: 65 mg, Female: 65 mg, Pregnant: , Lactating:  4–8 years: Male: 110 mg, Female: 110 mg, Pregnant: , Lactating:  9–18 years: Male: 350 mg, Female: 350 mg, Pregnant: 350 mg, Lactating: 350 mg 19+ years: Male: 350 mg, Female: 350 mg, Pregnant: 350 mg, Lactating: 350 mg Interactions with Medications Several types of medications have the potential to interact with magnesium supplements or affect magnesium status. A few examples are provided below. People taking these and other medications on a regular basis should discuss their magnesium intakes with their health care providers. Bisphosphonates Magnesium-rich supplements or medications can decrease the absorption of oral bisphosphonates, such as alendronate (Fosamax), used to treat osteoporosis . Use of magnesium-rich supplements or medications and oral bisphosphonates should be separated by at least 2 hours . Antibiotics Magnesium can form insoluble complexes with tetracyclines, such as demeclocycline (Declomycin) and doxycycline (Vibramycin) as well as quinolone antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin (Cipro) and levofloxacin (Levaquin). These antibiotics should be taken at least 2 hours before or 4–6 hours after a magnesium-containing supplement . Diuretics Chronic treatment with loop diuretics, such as furosemide (Lasix) and bumetanide (Bumex), and thiazide diuretics, such as hydrochlorothiazide (Aquazide H) and ethacrynic acid (Edecrin), can increase the loss of magnesium in urine and lead to magnesium depletion . In contrast, potassium-sparing diuretics, such as amiloride (Midamor) and spironolactone (Aldactone), reduce magnesium excretion . Proton pump inhibitors Prescription proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drugs, such as esomeprazole magnesium (Nexium) and lansoprazole (Prevacid), when taken for prolonged periods (typically more than a year) can cause hypomagnesemia . In cases that FDA reviewed, magnesium supplements often raised the low serum magnesium levels caused by PPIs. However, in 25% of the cases, supplements did not raise magnesium levels and the patients had to discontinue the PPI. FDA advises health care professionals to consider measuring patients' serum magnesium levels prior to initiating long-term PPI treatment and to check magnesium levels in these patients periodically . Magnesium and Healthful Diets The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\" For more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that Includes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils. Whole grains and dark-green, leafy vegetables are good sources of magnesium. Low-fat milk and yogurt contain magnesium as well. Some ready-to-eat breakfast cereals are fortified with magnesium.

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet. Introduction The two major classes of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are the omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Like all fatty acids, PUFAs consist of long chains of carbon atoms with a carboxyl group at one end of the chain and a methyl group at the other. PUFAs are distinguished from saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids by the presence of two or more double bonds between carbons within the fatty acid chain. Omega-3 fatty acids (omega-3s) have a carbon–carbon double bond located three carbons from the methyl end of the chain. Omega-3s, sometimes referred to as n-3s, are present in certain foods such as flaxseed and fish as well as dietary supplements such as fish oil. Several different omega-3s exist, but the majority of scientific research focuses on three: alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). ALA contains 18 carbon atoms, whereas EPA and DHA are considered long-chain (LC) omega-3s because EPA contains 20 carbons and DHA contains 22. PUFAs are frequently designated by their number of carbon atoms and double bonds. ALA, for example, is known as C18:3n-3 because it has 18 carbons and 3 double bonds and is an n-3, or omega-3, fatty acid. Similarly, EPA is known as C20:5n-3 and DHA as C22:6n-3. Omega-6 fatty acids (omega-6s) have a carbon–carbon double bond that is six carbons away from the methyl end of the fatty acid chain. Linoleic acid (C18:2n-6) and arachidonic acid (C20:4n-6) are two of the major omega-6s. The human body can only form carbon–carbon double bonds after the ninth carbon from the methyl end of a fatty acid . Therefore, ALA and linoleic acid are considered essential fatty acids, meaning that they must be obtained from the diet . ALA can be converted into EPA and then to DHA, but the conversion (which occurs primarily in the liver) is very limited, with reported rates of less than 15% . Therefore, consuming EPA and DHA directly from foods and/or dietary supplements is the only practical way to increase levels of these fatty acids in the body. ALA is present in plant oils, such as flaxseed, soybean, and canola oils . DHA and EPA are present in fish, fish oils, and krill oils, but they are originally synthesized by microalgae at the base of the marine food chain, not by the fish. As microalgae move up the food chain, fish acquire the omega-3s and accumulate them in their tissues . After ingestion, dietary lipids are hydrolyzed in the intestinal lumen . The hydrolysis products—monoglycerides and free fatty acids—are then incorporated into bile-salt– containing micelles and absorbed into enterocytes, largely by passive diffusion. The process is efficient, with an absorption rate of about 95%, which is similar to that of other ingested fats . Within intestinal cells, free fatty acids are primarily incorporated into chylomicrons and enter the circulation via the lymphatic system . Once in the bloodstream, lipoprotein particles circulate within the body, delivering lipids to various organs for subsequent oxidation, metabolism, or storage in adipose tissue . Omega-3s play important roles in the body as components of the phospholipids that form the structures of cell membranes . DHA, in particular, is especially high in the retina, brain, and sperm . In addition to their structural role in cell membranes, omega-3s (along with omega-6s) provide energy for the body and are used to form eicosanoids. Eicosanoids are signaling molecules that have similar chemical structures to the fatty acids from which they are derived; they have wide-ranging functions in the body's cardiovascular, pulmonary, immune, and endocrine systems . The eicosanoids made from omega-6s are generally more potent mediators of inflammation, vasoconstriction, and platelet aggregation than those made from omega-3s, although there are some exceptions . Because both classes of fatty acids compete for the same desaturation enzymes, ALA is a competitive inhibitor of linoleic acid metabolism and vice versa . Similarly, EPA and DHA can compete with arachidonic acid for the synthesis of eicosanoids. Thus, higher concentrations of EPA and DHA than arachidonic acid tip the eicosanoid balance toward less inflammatory activity . Some researchers propose that the relative intakes of omega-6s and omega-3s—the omega-6/omega-3 ratio—may have important implications for the pathogenesis of many chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer , but the optimal ratio—if any—has not been defined . Others have concluded that such ratios are too nonspecific and are insensitive to individual fatty acid levels [11-13]. Most agree that raising EPA and DHA blood levels is far more important than lowering linoleic acid or arachidonic acid levels. Currently, most clinicians do not assess omega-3 status, but it can be done by measuring individual omega-3s in plasma or serum phospholipids and expressing them as the percentage of total phospholipid fatty acids by weight [14-16]. Experts have not established normal ranges, but mean values for serum or plasma phospholipid EPA plus DHA among U.S. adults not taking omega-3 supplements are about 3%–4% [14-16]. Plasma and serum fatty acid values, however, can vary substantially based on an individual's most recent meal, so they do not reflect long-term dietary consumption . It is also possible to assess omega-3 status via analysis of erythrocyte fatty acids, a measurement that reflects longer term intakes over approximately the previous 120 days . The omega-3 index proposed by Harris and von Schacky reflects the content of EPA plus DHA in erythrocyte membranes expressed as a percentage of total erythrocyte fatty acids . This index can be used as a surrogate for assessing tissue levels of EPA plus DHA . EPA and DHA typically comprise about 3%–5% of erythrocyte fatty acids in Western populations with low fish intakes. In Japan, where fish consumption is high, erythrocyte EPA and DHA levels are about twice those of Western populations . Recommended Intakes Intake recommendations for fatty acids and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) (now called the National Academy of Medicine) . DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following: Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects When the IOM last reviewed omega-3s, insufficient data were available to establish an EAR, so the IOM established AIs for all ages based on omega-3 intakes in healthy populations . Table 1 lists the current AIs for omega-3s in grams per day. Human milk contains omega-3s as ALA, EPA, and DHA, so the IOM established an AI for infants from birth to 12 months that is equivalent to the mean intake of omega-3s in healthy, breastfed infants. For infants, the AIs apply to total omega-3s. For age 1 and older, the AIs apply only to ALA because ALA is the only omega-3 that is essential. The IOM did not establish specific intake recommendations for EPA, DHA, or other LC omega-3s. Table 1: Adequate Intakes (AIs) for Omega-3s Birth to 6 months*: Male: 0.5 g, Female: 0.5 g, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  7–12 months*: Male: 0.5 g, Female: 0.5 g, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  1–3 years**: Male: 0.7 g, Female: 0.7 g, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  4–8 years**: Male: 0.9 g, Female: 0.9 g, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  9–13 years**: Male: 1.2 g, Female: 1.0 g, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  14–18 years**: Male: 1.6 g, Female: 1.1 g, Pregnancy: 1.4 g, Lactation: 1.3 g 19–50 years**: Male: 1.6 g, Female: 1.1 g, Pregnancy: 1.4 g, Lactation: 1.3 g 51+ years**: Male: 1.6 g, Female: 1.1 g, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  *As total omega-3s **As ALA Sources of Omega-3s Food Plant oils that contain ALA include flaxseed (linseed), soybean, and canola oils . Chia seeds and walnuts also contain ALA. The omega-3 content of fish varies widely. Cold-water fatty fish, such as salmon, mackerel, tuna, herring, and sardines, contain high amounts of LC omega-3s, whereas fish with a lower fat content—such as bass, tilapia, and cod—as well as shellfish contain lower levels . The omega-3 content of fish also depends on the composition of the food that the fish consumes . Farmed fish usually have higher levels of EPA and DHA than wild-caught fish, but it depends on the food they are fed . An analysis of the fatty acid composition of farm-raised Atlantic salmon from Scotland showed that the EPA and DHA content significantly decreased between 2006 and 2015 due to the replacement of traditional marine ingredients in fish feed with other ingredients . Beef is very low in omega-3s, but beef from grass-fed cows contains somewhat higher levels of omega-3s, mainly as ALA, than that from grain-fed cows . Some foods, such as certain brands of eggs, yogurt, juices, milk, and soy beverages, are fortified with DHA and other omega-3s. Since 2002, manufacturers have added DHA and arachidonic acid (the two most prevalent LC PUFAs in the brain) to most infant formulas available in the United States . Several food sources of ALA, DHA, and/or EPA are listed in Table 2. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has established a Daily Value (DV) of 65 g for total fat but not for omega-3s. Thus, Table 2 presents the amounts of omega-3 fatty acids in grams per serving only and not the percent of the DV.

The USDA's FoodData Central website lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides a comprehensive list of foods containing ALA arranged by nutrient content and by food name, foods containing DHA arranged by nutrient content and by food name, and foods containing EPA arranged by nutrient content and by food name. Dietary Supplements LC omega-3s are present in several dietary supplement formulations, including fish oil, krill oil, cod liver oil, and vegetarian products that contain algal oil. A typical fish oil supplement provides about 1,000 mg fish oil, containing 180 mg EPA and 120 mg DHA, but doses vary widely . Cod liver oil supplements provide vitamin A and vitamin D in addition to LC omega-3s. Although seafood contains varying levels of methyl mercury (a toxic heavy metal) , omega-3 supplements have not been found to contain this contaminant because it is removed during processing and purification . Dietary supplements can contain several different forms of omega-3s, including natural triglycerides, free fatty acids, ethyl esters, re-esterified triglycerides, and phospholipids [32-34]. Natural triglycerides are the form that occur naturally in fish oil, whereas ethyl esters are synthesized from natural triglycerides by replacement of the glycerol molecule of the triglyceride with ethanol. Re-esterified triglycerides are formed by the conversion of ethyl esters back to triglycerides. Omega-3s as re-esterified triglycerides, natural triglycerides, and free fatty acids have somewhat higher bioavailability than ethyl esters, but consumption of all forms significantly increases plasma EPA and DHA levels . Krill oil contains omega-3s primarily as phospholipids. Some studies suggest that these phospholipids have somewhat higher bioavailability than the omega-3s in fish oil, whereas other studies do not . Plant-based sources of omega-3s from algal oil usually provide around 100–300 mg DHA; some contain EPA as well. These supplements typically contain omega-3s in the triglyceride form . According to a small study, the bioavailability of DHA from algal oil is equivalent to that from cooked salmon . Formulations of omega-3 dietary supplements vary widely, so it is important to check product labels to determine the types and amounts of omega-3s in these products. The Dietary Supplement Label Database from the National Institutes of Health contains label information from many dietary supplements on the market that contain omega-3s. Omega-3 Intakes and Status According to data from the 2011–2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), most children and adults in the United States consume recommended amounts of omega-3s as ALA . Among children and teens age 2–19 the average daily ALA intake from foods is 1.32 g for females and 1.55 g for males. In adults age 20 and over, the average daily ALA intake from foods is 1.59 g in females and 2.06 g in males. Consumption of DHA and EPA from foods contributes a very small amount to total daily omega-3 intakes (about 40 mg in children and teens and about 90 mg in adults) . Use of dietary supplements containing omega-3s also contributes to total omega-3 intakes. Fish oil is one of the most commonly used nonvitamin/nonmineral dietary supplements by U.S. adults and children . Data from the 2012 National Health Interview Survey indicate that 7.8% of U.S. adults and 1.1% of U.S. children use supplements containing fish oil, omega-3s, and/or DHA or EPA . According to an analysis of 2003–2008 NHANES data, use of these supplements adds about 100 mg to mean daily ALA intakes, 10 mg to mean DHA intakes, and 20 mg to mean EPA intakes in adults . Omega-3 Deficiency A deficiency of essential fatty acids—either omega-3s or omega-6s—can cause rough, scaly skin and dermatitis . Plasma and tissue concentrations of DHA decrease when an omega-3 fatty acid deficiency is present. However, there are no known cut-off concentrations of DHA or EPA below which functional endpoints, such as those for visual or neural function or for immune response, are impaired. Groups at Risk of Omega-3 Inadequacy Evidence that higher LC omega-3 levels are associated with a reduced risk of several chronic diseases, including coronary heart disease, suggests that many Americans could benefit from slightly higher intakes. However, classical essential fatty acid deficiency in healthy individuals in the United States is virtually nonexistent . During periods of dietary-fat restriction or malabsorption accompanied by an energy deficit, the body releases essential fatty acids from adipose-tissue reserves. For this reason, clinical signs of essential fatty-acid deficiency are usually only found in patients receiving parenteral nutrition that lacks PUFAs. This was documented in case reports during the 1970s and 1980s , but all current enteral and parenteral feeding solutions contain adequate levels of PUFAs. Omega-3s and Health The potential health benefits of consuming omega-3s are the focus of a great deal of scientific research. By far, the majority of research has focused on EPA and DHA from foods (e.g., fish) and/or dietary supplements (e.g., fish oil) as opposed to ALA from plant-based foods. Many observational studies link higher intakes of fish and other seafood with improved health outcomes. However, it is difficult to ascertain whether the benefits are due to the omega-3 content of the seafood (which varies among species), other components in the seafood, the substitution of seafood for other less healthful foods, other healthful behaviors, or a combination of these factors. Data from randomized clinical trials are needed to shed light on these questions. This section focuses on areas of health in which omega-3s might be involved: CVD and its risk factors; infant health and neurodevelopment; cancer prevention; Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and cognitive function; age-related macular degeneration; dry eye disease; rheumatoid arthritis; and other conditions. Cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular disease risk factors Many studies have assessed the effects of omega-3s—primarily EPA and DHA—on CVD and CVD risk factors, such as high blood pressure and elevated plasma lipids. This interest was spurred by epidemiological research dating back to the 1970s that found low rates of myocardial infarction and other coronary events among Greenland Inuit and other fish-eating populations, such as those in Japan . Results from observational studies have been consistent with these findings, with several systematic reviews and meta-analyses showing that higher consumption of fish and higher dietary or plasma levels of omega-3s are associated with a lower risk of heart failure, coronary disease, and fatal coronary heart disease . Clinical trial data from the 1989 Diet and Reinfarction Trial, the 1999 open-label GISSI-Prevenzione trial, and others supported the hypothesis that LC omega-3s offer protection from CVD by reducing the heart’s susceptibility to arrhythmias, lowering triglyceride levels, lowering blood pressure, and decreasing platelet aggregation [50-55]. The authors of a systematic review that included six secondary-prevention trials and one primary-prevention trial of omega-3 supplementation published between 1966 and 2005 concluded that consumption of LC omega-3s from fish and fish oil supplements reduces rates of all-cause mortality, cardiac death, sudden death, and stroke . They noted that the evidence of benefit is stronger for secondary than for primary prevention. Results from the Japan EPA Lipid Intervention Study in 2007 supported the growing body of evidence that LC omega-3s reduce the risk of heart disease, especially in people with a history of coronary artery disease . In this study, 18,645 people with hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol of at least 251 mg/dL) with or without coronary artery disease received either 1.8 g/day EPA plus a statin or a statin only. After a mean of 4.6 years, the EPA group had 19% fewer major coronary events than the control group. The EPA group also experienced a significant reduction in rates of unstable angina and nonfatal coronary events but not in rates of sudden cardiac death or coronary death in comparison with the control group. In an analysis of the primary prevention subgroup from this study (participants with no history of coronary artery disease), EPA supplementation had no significant effects on any outcome. However, for the secondary prevention subgroup (those with a history of coronary artery disease), the EPA group had a 28% reduction in the rate of unstable angina and a 19% reduction in that of major coronary events. A separate analysis of data from this study found that the EPA supplementation did not affect total stroke incidence but did reduce the risk of recurrent stroke by 20% in patients who had previously experienced a stroke . Several subsequent clinical trials, however, had largely null findings [58-60]. For example, the 2012 Outcome Reduction with an Initial Glargine Intervention (ORIGIN) trial included 12,536 patients who had diabetes or a high risk of diabetes and a high risk of cardiovascular events. Supplementation with 1 g/day omega-3s (375 mg DHA and 465 mg EPA) for about 6 years significantly lowered triglyceride levels but had no effect on risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes in comparison with placebo . Similarly, in the 2010 Alpha Omega Trial, low-dose EPA and DHA supplementation (150 mg DHA and 226 mg EPA daily, supplied in a margarine) for 40 months also failed to reduce the rate of major cardiovascular events in comparison with placebo among 4,837 older men and women who had previously experienced a myocardial infarction and were receiving antihypertensive, antithrombotic, and/or lipid-lowering medications . Scientists gained additional insight into the effects of omega-3s for the primary prevention of CVD, including in patients with diabetes, from two 2018 trials: VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) and A Study of Cardiovascular Events in Diabetes (ASCEND) . Both trials compared the same 1 g/day omega-3 formulation (460 mg EPA and 380 mg DHA) with placebo, but in different populations. VITAL included 25,871 men age 50 and older and women age 55 and older with no previous heart attacks, strokes, or cancer, whereas ASCEND included 15,480 adults age 40 or older with diabetes but no evidence of CVD. VITAL also tested the omega-3 supplement with and without 2,000 International Units (IU)/day vitamin D. In VITAL, the omega-3 supplement did not significantly reduce the rate of major cardiovascular events combined (myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular mortality) after a median of 5.3 years . However, participants taking the omega-3 supplement did experience a statistically significant 28% reduction in total myocardial infarction rates (including a 77% reduction among African Americans and a 40% reduction among those who consumed less than 1.5 servings of fish per week). Supplement users also had significant reductions in rates of fatal myocardial infarction, total coronary heart disease, and percutaneous coronary intervention (a procedure that widens blocked or narrowed coronary arteries). No significant reductions in stroke or death rates from cardiovascular causes were observed. ASCEND had similar findings . After a mean follow-up of 7.4 years, the omega-3 supplement did not significantly affect the risk of a serious vascular event (composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke, transient ischemic attack, and cardiovascular death, excluding intracranial hemorrhage) or revascularization. However, omega-3 supplementation did significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular death by 19% in comparison with placebo. The 2019 Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl-Intervention Trial (REDUCE-IT) found significant CVD benefits with Vascepa, a high-dose, prescription form of omega-3s containing EPA in the form of icosapent ethyl (IPE), an ethyl ester . REDUCE-IT included 8,179 participants with CVD age 45 years or older or with diabetes and at least one other risk factor age 50 years or older. All participants had a fasting triglyceride level of 135 to 499 mg/dL even though they were receiving statin therapy, and an LDL cholesterol level of 41 to 100 mg/dL. Participants received either 4 g/day IPE or a placebo of mineral oil for a median of 4.9 years. IPE significantly reduced rates of cardiovascular events (a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularization, and unstable angina) by 25%. IPE also significantly reduced rates of other outcomes, including cardiovascular death by 20%, fatal or nonfatal stroke by 28%, and fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction by 31%. A subsequent 2020 clinical trial known as STRENGTH (Long-Term Outcomes Study to Assess Statin Residual Risk with Epanova in High Cardiovascular Risk Patients with Hypertriglyceridemia) found no significant CVD benefits with Epanova, a high-dose, prescription form of omega-3s containing EPA and DHA in a carboxylic acid form (omega-3 CA) . STRENGTH included 13,078 participants from 22 countries (mean age 62.5 years) at high cardiovascular risk, including hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL cholesterol, diabetes, and established CVD. Participants received either 4 g/day omega-3 CA or a placebo of corn oil in addition to their usual therapies, including statins, for a projected trial duration of 4.5 years. However, the trial was stopped after participants were treated for a median of about 3.5 years when the probability of benefit from omega-3 CA appeared low and the supplemented group had a higher incidence of atrial fibrillation. Omega-3 CA did not significantly reduce the composite end point of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, or hospitalization for unstable angina. The omega-3 form, study population, background dietary omega-3 intakes, and use of statins and other cardioprotective therapies might explain some conflicting findings among studies [17,59,60,65-72]. In addition, dose probably plays a major role in the ability of omega-3 supplementation to confer significant benefits . The REDUCE-IT findings suggest that a high daily dose of IPE, 4 g, is an effective adjunct to statin therapy in people with CVD or a high risk of CVD . The daily dose of 1 g used in many studies of omega-3 dietary supplements might affect some CVD pathways but has had no significant effect on the primary outcomes in several trials . However, both the REDUCE-IT and STRENGTH studies used similar doses of omega-3s (4 g/day) but reported significant CVD benefit in the former and none in the latter. The reasons for the different results are not clear, but a partial explanation—beyond differences in the omega-3 formulation (ethyl ester EPA vs. carboxylic acid EPA and DHA) and the baseline health of the study population—may lie with the different placebo comparators used, mineral oil in REDUCE-IT and corn oil in STRENGTH . Mineral oil is not a neutral placebo; it affects lipid levels and inflammatory markers and may inhibit the absorption of statin drugs. Therefore, in REDUCE-IT, differences in CVD events between the treatment and placebo groups would likely be smaller if a more neutral placebo oil had been used. Furthermore, in the clinical trials mentioned above, the effects of LC omega-3s are not uniform across CVD outcomes. Therefore, use of primary composite endpoints that combine multiple outcomes might dilute significant effects on individual components of those endpoints . A 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis of 13 trials included ASCEND, VITAL, and REDUCE-IT (but not STRENGTH) and a total of 127,477 participants . LC omega-3 doses ranged from 0.376 to 4 g/day, and the mean treatment duration was 5 years. The authors concluded that LC-omega-3 supplementation reduces the risk of myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease death, total coronary heart disease, CVD death, and total CVD and the effects appear to be dose related. However, the findings showed no significant associations for risk of fatal and nonfatal stroke. The authors noted that REDUCE-IT reduced risk of stroke significantly , suggesting that a higher dose of omega-3s (4 g/day) might be needed to affect this outcome. A 2020 Cochrane Review of 86 randomized controlled trials published between 1968 and 2019 found that 0.5 g/day to more than 5 g/day LC omega-3s for 12 to 88 months in a total of 162,796 participants reduced serum triglyceride levels by about 15% and slightly decreased rates of cardiovascular mortality and coronary heart disease events . However, the supplements did not affect all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events, stroke, or arrhythmia. The authors of several earlier meta-analyses and systematic reviews, as well as a 2016 report from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), concluded that omega-3 supplements do not appear to significantly reduce the risk of most cardiovascular events [68-70,76-87]. Many of these analyses [68-70,81-86], however, but not all , did find that omega-3s reduce the risk of cardiac death. Between 2017 and 2019, the American Heart Association (AHA) released three science advisories on omega-3s . All three advisories recommend one to two servings of seafood per week to reduce the risk of congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and sudden cardiac death, especially when the seafood replaces less healthy foods . For people with existing coronary heart disease, such as a recent myocardial infarction, the AHA recommends approximately 1 g/day EPA plus DHA, preferably from oily fish; however, supplements could also be considered under the direction of a physician . The AHA does not recommend omega-3 supplements for people who do not have a high CVD risk. To manage high triglyceride levels, the AHA concludes that 4 g/day prescription omega-3s (containing EPA plus DHA or EPA only) lower triglyceride levels when used alone or as adjuncts to other lipid-lowering medications . Although this finding pertains to high-dose prescription omega-3s, an earlier analysis of 58 trials also revealed a dose-response relationship between lower-dose dietary and supplemental omega-3 intakes and triglyceride levels . Each increase of 1 g/day of LC omega-3 reduced triglyceride levels by 5.9 mg/dL, and the effect was stronger in people with higher baseline triglyceride levels. The 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans states that strong evidence from mostly prospective cohort studies but also some randomized controlled trials shows that eating patterns that include seafood are associated with a reduced risk of CVD . In addition, consuming about 8 ounces per week of a variety of seafood that provides about 250 mg per day EPA and DHA is associated with fewer cardiac deaths in both healthy individuals and those with preexisting CVD. Overall, research indicates that consuming fish and other types of seafood as part of a balanced diet promotes heart health, especially when the seafood is consumed in place of less healthy foods. Fish oil and other LC omega-3 supplements lower triglyceride levels and might reduce the risk of some cardiovascular endpoints, especially among people with low dietary omega-3 intakes. Evidence of a protective effect for omega-3 supplementation is stronger for people with existing coronary heart disease than for healthy individuals. In 2004, FDA approved a qualified health claim for conventional foods and dietary supplements that contain EPA and DHA . This health claim states, \"Supportive but not conclusive research shows that consumption of EPA and DHA omega-3 fatty acids may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.\" FDA also specifies that the labels of dietary supplements should not recommend a daily intake of EPA and DHA higher than 2 g . Infant health and neurodevelopment Numerous studies have examined the effects of maternal seafood and omega-3 intakes on infant birth weight, length of gestation, visual and cognitive development, and other infant health outcomes. High concentrations of DHA are present in the cellular membranes of the brain and retina , and DHA is important for fetal growth and development. The accumulation of DHA in the retina is complete by birth, whereas accumulation in the brain continues throughout the first 2 years after birth. Observational studies indicate that maternal consumption, during pregnancy and breastfeeding, of at least 8 ounces per week of seafood that contains DHA is associated with better infant health outcomes . For example, in a prospective cohort study of 341 mother–child pairs in the United States, maternal fish consumption more than twice per week compared to no weekly consumption was associated with improved visual motor skills in their children at age 3 after adjustment for covariates such as maternal age, education, maternal smoking and alcohol use during pregnancy, paternal education, and fetal growth . In another observational cohort study in the United Kingdom in 11,875 pregnant women who reported seafood intakes ranging from none to more than 340 g (about 12 ounces) per week, lower consumption of seafood during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of suboptimal communication skills in the offspring at ages 6 and 18 months and suboptimal verbal IQ and prosocial behavior at age 7–8 years . It is not possible to establish causality, however, because all of these studies were observational. Seafood contains varying levels of methyl mercury . However, results from numerous studies, including a systematic review of the literature on maternal fish intake and subsequent neurodevelopmental outcomes, show that the health benefits of consuming moderate amounts of seafood during the prenatal period outweigh the risks [94-97]. Several randomized controlled trials have examined whether supplementation with fish oil, EPA, and/or DHA during pregnancy and early infancy is beneficial for infant health and neurodevelopment. One of these trials examined the effects of fish oil supplementation in 2,399 pregnant women on the subsequent clinical outcomes and neurodevelopment of their children . Pregnant women received daily supplements of either fish oil (providing 800 mg DHA and 100 mg EPA) or placebo from less than 21 weeks’ gestation until the birth of their child. Compared to the placebo group, children of mothers who received fish oil were heavier at birth and less likely to be born very preterm (less than 34 weeks' gestation). However, assessments of 726 of the children (all 96 preterm children and 630 randomly selected full-term children) found no differences between groups in mean cognitive composite scores or mean language composite scores at age 18 months. A follow-up study of the children at age 4 years found no differences between groups in general conceptual ability score or other assessments of cognition, language, and executive functioning . Another study found no benefits on visual function at age 7 years when very preterm infants (less than 33 weeks' gestation) consumed human milk with a higher DHA concentration than normal (lactating mothers took 900 mg/day DHA supplements) for the first months of life until full term . In a clinical trial in 420 healthy full-term infants, those who received either DHA-enriched fish oil (250 mg DHA and 60 mg EPA) or placebo daily from birth to 6 months had similar scores on neurodevelopment assessments at 18 months . However, infants receiving fish oil had significantly better performance on language assessments, indicating some benefit for early communication development. The authors of a systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials concluded that the evidence neither supports nor refutes the benefits of LC omega-3 supplementation during pregnancy for cognitive or visual development in infants . Another systematic review and meta-analysis that included two randomized controlled trials in women with a previous preterm birth found no significant differences in rates of recurrent preterm birth between women who took omega-3 supplements during pregnancy and those who did not . Omega-3 supplementation did, however, increase latency (time from randomization to birth) by about 2 days and mean birth weight by about 103 g. In 2016, AHRQ published a review on the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on child and maternal health . This comprehensive report evaluated the findings from 95 randomized controlled trials and 48 prospective longitudinal studies and nested case-control studies. Most studies examined the effects of fish oil supplements or other DHA and EPA combinations in pregnant or breastfeeding women or of infant formula fortified with DHA plus arachidonic acid, an omega-6. The authors concluded that, except for small beneficial effects on infant birth weight and length of gestation, omega-3 supplementation or fortification has no consistent effects on infant health outcomes. The 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans states that women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should consume 8–12 ounces of seafood per week, choosing from varieties that are higher in EPA and DHA and lower in methyl mercury , such as salmon, herring, sardines, and trout. These women should not consume certain types of fish, such as king mackerel, shark, swordfish, and tilefish that are high in methyl mercury, and they should limit the amount of white (albacore) tuna they consume to 6 ounces a week . The American Academy of Pediatrics has similar advice for breastfeeding women, recommending intakes of 200–300 mg DHA per day by consuming one to two servings of fish per week to guarantee a sufficient amount of DHA in breast milk . Most currently available infant formulas in the United States contain DHA and arachidonic acid. However, the authors of a paper published by the American Academy of Family Physicians and of two Cochrane Reviews (one on full-term infants and one on preterm infants) have concluded that the evidence is insufficient to recommend the use of infant formulas that are supplemented with these fatty acids [105-107]. Cancer prevention Researchers have hypothesized that higher intakes of omega-3s from either foods or supplements might reduce the risk of cancer due to their anti-inflammatory effects and potential to inhibit cell growth factors . Results from observational studies, however, have been inconsistent and vary by cancer site and other factors, including gender and genetic risk. For example, some studies have shown associations between higher intakes and/or blood levels of omega-3s and a decreased risk of certain cancers, including breast and colorectal cancers . Other studies have found no associations between omega-3s and cancer risk, and some have even found associations in the opposite direction, suggesting that omega-3s might increase the risk of certain cancers such as prostate cancer . The first large-scale clinical trial to examine the effects of omega-3s on the primary prevention of cancer in the general population was the newly published VITAL trial. This clinical trial examined the effects of omega-3 fish oil supplementation (1 g/day containing 460 mg EPA and 380 mg DHA) with or without 2,000 IU/day vitamin D for a median of 5.3 years . The study included 25,871 men age 50 and older and women age 55 and older with no previous cancer, heart attacks, or strokes. Compared with placebo, the omega-3 supplement had no significant effect on cancer incidence, cancer mortality rates, or the development of breast, prostate, or colorectal cancers. Evidence from several observational studies suggests that higher intakes of LC omega-3s are associated with a lower risk of breast cancer, but clinical trials are needed to confirm this finding. In the prospective Singapore Chinese Health Study of 35,298 women age 45–74 years, those in the top three quartiles of dietary LC omega-3 intake had a 26% lower risk of breast cancer after an average of 5.3 years of follow-up than those in the lowest quartile . Similarly, among 35,016 female participants age 50–76 years in the Vitamins And Lifestyle cohort, those who reported current use of fish oil supplements had a 32% lower risk of breast cancer after a mean of 6 years than those who did not take fish oil . According to a systematic review of three case-control studies and five prospective studies published in 2007–2011, evidence is increasing that higher intakes of dietary and supplemental LC omega-3s are associated with a lower risk of breast cancer . Similarly, the authors of a meta-analysis of data from 21 prospective cohort studies concluded that women with the highest dietary intakes and/or tissue levels of LC omega-3s had a 14% lower risk of breast cancer than those with the lowest intakes and tissue levels . These authors also found a dose-response relationship between higher intakes of combined LC omega-3s and reduced breast cancer risk. Intakes of ALA and of fish, however, had no association with differences in breast cancer risk. This finding, which could be due to varying levels of omega-3s in different fish species, warrants further investigation. Limited evidence from observational studies suggests that greater consumption of fish and LC omega-3s is associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer . The authors of a meta-analysis of 19 prospective cohort studies found no significant association between fish intake and risk of colorectal cancer overall. However, a stratified analysis showed that for participants with the highest fish consumption (those who ate fish at least seven times more often per month than those with the lowest fish consumption), the risk of colorectal cancer was 22% lower than that for the lowest fish consumers . Results from a more recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 22 prospective cohort studies and 19 case-control studies indicate that fish consumption is inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk. In this analysis, 21 of the studies distinguished between colon cancer and rectal cancer. The risk of rectal cancer was 21% lower for participants with the highest fish intakes (as much as one serving/day) compared to those with the lowest fish intakes (as little as none), but fish consumption had no significant association with risk of colon cancer alone . Results from the Vitamins And Lifestyle cohort study suggest that associations between fish or LC omega-3 intakes and colorectal cancer risk might vary by such factors as gender and genetic risk. In this study, researchers evaluated associations between colorectal cancer risk and EPA/DHA intakes from fatty fish (salmon and fresh tuna) and fish oil supplements in 68,109 Washington residents age 50–76 . The amount of fatty fish consumed ranged from none to 0.8 servings per week or more. Overall, EPA and DHA intakes (from either diet or supplements) and fatty fish consumption were not associated with colorectal cancer risk, but associations varied by genetic characteristics (certain inherited genetic mutations are associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer). For individuals in the lowest two tertiles of genetic risk, higher fatty fish consumption and higher total EPA and DHA intakes were inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk. For individuals in the highest tertile of genetic risk, higher total EPA and DHA intakes were positively associated with colorectal cancer risk. Risk also varied by gender. Among men, use of fish oil supplements reduced colorectal cancer risk by an average of 34% or more depending on the frequency and duration of use, but this effect did not occur among women. Additional research is needed to clarify possible associations between fish and omega-3 intakes and colorectal cancer risk. Several prospective and case-control studies have investigated associations between either blood levels or intakes of omega-3s and risk of low-grade or high-grade prostate cancer. Results from these studies have been inconsistent. A few case-control and case-cohort studies have found positive associations between blood levels of LC omega-3s and prostate cancer risk (particularly high-grade disease that is more advanced and more likely to spread than low-grade cancer), suggesting that omega-3s might increase prostate cancer risk. In a nested case-control analysis of men age 55–84 years participating in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial, serum phospholipid levels of DHA were positively associated with risk of high-grade, but not low-grade, prostate cancer . Serum EPA levels, however, were not associated with risk of either grade of the disease. Similarly, results from a case-cohort study within the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention (SELECT) trial showed that men in the highest quartile of plasma phospholipid LC omega-3s had a 44% higher risk of low-grade prostate cancer and a 71% higher risk of high-grade prostate cancer than those in the lowest quartile . An analysis of data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort also found a higher prostate cancer risk in men with higher plasma levels of LC omega-3s . Among Whites participating in the Multiethnic Cohort Study, higher levels of omega-3s in erythrocyte membranes and higher ratios of omega-3s to omega-6s were both associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer. However, the results showed no associations, even with advanced or high-grade disease, for other ethnic groups or for the population as a whole . Although the findings from the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial and the SELECT trial suggest that higher LC omega-3 intakes might increase prostate cancer risk, some scientists have questioned the significance of these findings . They have noted, for example, that in the SELECT trial , the difference in the omega-3 levels in the men with and without prostate cancer was very small and of questionable physiological significance. Other scientists have pointed out that localized (even high-grade) prostate cancers usually progress slowly and are common on autopsy in men who have died from other causes, suggesting that prostate cancer mortality is a more critical endpoint than prostate cancer incidence . Finally, desaturation enzymes that convert ALA into EPA and DHA can be upregulated in some cancer cells, suggesting the possibility that it was the disease that raised the omega-3 levels, not the omega-3 levels that raised the disease risk . Results from other observational studies using dietary intake data suggest that higher intakes of fish and/or omega-3s reduce prostate cancer risk. Both fish and omega-3 consumption were associated with a lower risk of fatal prostate cancer in a cohort of 293,464 men participating in the NIH-AARP study . In the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, a prospective cohort of more than 47,000 men age 40–75 years, those who consumed fish more than three times per week had a lower risk of metastatic prostate cancer than those who consumed fish less than twice per month . However, men who used fish oil supplements did not have a decreased risk of prostate cancer. A number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of prospective studies of the effects of fish intakes, omega-3 intakes, and omega-3 blood levels on prostate cancer risk have had inconsistent findings as well. For example, circulating levels of EPA, but not DHA, were positively associated with prostate cancer risk in a meta-analysis of 5,098 men with prostate cancer and 6,649 men without prostate cancer from seven studies . Another meta-analysis of 12 studies that included 4,516 men with prostate cancer and 5,728 men without prostate cancer found that high serum levels of these LC omega-3s were positively associated with high-grade disease . In other analyses, dietary intakes of LC omega-3s had no effect on prostate cancer risk , whereas fish consumption decreased prostate cancer mortality but had no effect on prostate cancer incidence . A 2015 meta-analysis found no significant associations between dietary intakes or blood levels of LC omega-3s and total prostate cancer risk . The authors noted that most dietary-intake studies included in their meta-analysis found inverse associations, whereas biomarker studies of blood levels of these fatty acids found positive associations. Overall, the evidence to date shows no consistent relationships between prostate cancer risk or mortality and omega-3 intakes or blood levels. Evidence is limited for a role of omega-3s in the prevention of cancers at other sites. For example, evidence is insufficient to determine whether omega-3s affect the risk of skin cancers, including basal-cell carcinoma, squamous-cell carcinoma, and melanoma . Findings from the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study suggest that there is no association between total or individual omega-3 intakes from foods and ovarian cancer risk . Associations between omega-3 intakes and endometrial cancer have been mixed. Some evidence indicates that dietary intakes of EPA and DHA may provide protection from the development of endometrial cancer . Other evidence indicates that they decrease risk in women who are normal weight but have no effect or even increase risk in women with overweight or obesity . A systematic review and meta-analysis of nine prospective cohort and 10 case-control studies did not find an association between fish or LC-omega-3 intakes and risk of pancreatic cancer . Similarly, systematic reviews and meta-analyses have not found significant associations between fish consumption and risk of gastric or esophageal cancers . Overall, data from observational studies show no consistent relationship between omega-3s and overall cancer risk. Although some evidence suggests that higher LC omega-3 intakes reduce the risk of breast and possibly colorectal cancers, a large clinical trial found that LC omega-3 supplements did not reduce the overall risk of cancer or the risk of breast, prostate, or colorectal cancers. Additional randomized clinical trials in progress will help clarify whether omega-3s affect cancer risk. Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, and cognitive function Some, but not all, observational studies suggest that diets high in LC omega-3s are associated with a reduced risk of cognitive decline, Alzheimer's disease, and dementia . Because DHA is an essential component of cellular membrane phospholipids in the brain, researchers hypothesize that LC omega-3s might protect cognitive function by helping to maintain neuronal function and cell membrane integrity within the brain . This hypothesis is supported by findings from case-control studies indicating that patients with Alzheimer's disease have lower serum levels of DHA than cognitively healthy people . Lower serum DHA levels are also associated with more cerebral amyloidosis (build-up of protein deposits called amyloids) in healthy older adults, whereas higher DHA is correlated with preservation of brain volume . Several observational studies have examined the effects of fish, EPA, and/or DHA intakes on cognitive function in healthy older adults. In a prospective cohort study involving 210 healthy men age 70–89, fish consumption was associated with less cognitive decline at follow-up 5 years later . In addition, a dose-response relationship was observed between tertiles of dietary EPA plus DHA intake and subsequent 5-year cognitive decline. Similarly, in the Rotterdam Study, a population-based prospective study of people age 55 or older who were free from dementia at baseline, higher fish consumption among 5,386 study participants was associated with a 60% lower risk of dementia and a 70% lower risk of Alzheimer's disease over an average of 2.1 years . Subsequent follow-up 6 years after baseline, however, found no associations between omega-3 intakes and incidence of dementia or Alzheimer's disease . The authors suggest that the discrepancy might be explained by the short follow-up period in the first analysis and the small number of patients who developed dementia. A higher omega-3 index was associated with a greater hippocampal volume in the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study and with a larger brain volume and improved cognitive test scores in the Framingham Offspring cohort . A 2016 dose-response meta-analysis of 21 cohort studies found that increased intakes of fish and dietary DHA were both inversely associated with the risks of dementia and Alzheimer's disease . Specifically, a 100 mg/day incremental increase in DHA intake was associated with a 14% lower risk of dementia and a 37% lower risk of Alzheimer's disease. Results from clinical trials, however, suggest that LC omega-3 supplementation does not affect cognitive function in older adults who have no cognitive impairment. In a trial in the United Kingdom, 748 cognitively healthy adults age 70–79 years received either 500 mg DHA and 200 mg EPA or placebo daily for 24 months . Cognitive function did not differ significantly between the two groups, although cognitive function did not decline in either group. In the Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) clinical trial, treatment with 350 mg DHA and 650 mg EPA for 5 years did not have a significant effect on cognitive function in 3,501 older adults (mean age 72.7 years) with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) . Clinical trial results also suggest that LC omega-3 supplementation does not benefit patients with Alzheimer's disease, although it might help patients with mild cognitive impairment. For example, daily supplementation with 2 g DHA for 18 months did not slow the rate of cognitive decline compared to placebo in 295 participants (mean age 76 years) with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease . In the OmegaAD trial, daily supplementation with 1,700 mg DHA and 600 mg EPA for 6 months in 174 older adults with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease also failed to slow down the rate of cognitive decline compared to placebo . However, a subgroup of patients with very mild impairment experienced a significant reduction in the rate of cognitive decline. In a small trial in Malaysia, fish oil supplementation (1,290 mg DHA and 450 mg EPA daily) for 12 months improved memory—particularly short-term, working, and verbal memory—and delayed recall compared to placebo in 35 older adults with mild cognitive impairment . Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses, including a Cochrane Review, have assessed the effects of omega-3 supplementation on cognitive function and dementia in healthy older adults and those with Alzheimer's disease or cognitive impairment [136,151-153]. Overall, the findings indicate that LC omega-3 supplementation does not affect cognitive function in healthy older adults or in people with Alzheimer’s disease compared to placebo. For people with mild cognitive impairment, omega-3s may improve certain aspects of cognitive function, including attention, processing speed, and immediate recall . However, these findings need to be confirmed in additional clinical trials. Age-Related Macular Degeneration AMD is a major cause of vision loss among older adults. In most cases, severe vision loss is associated with advanced AMD, which consists of either central geographic atrophy (dry AMD, the most common form) or neovascular AMD (wet AMD) . Based on DHA's presence as a structural lipid in retinal cellular membranes and the beneficial effects of EPA-derived eicosanoids on retinal inflammation, neovascularization, and cell survival, researchers have suggested that these LC omega-3s have cytoprotective effects in the retina that may help prevent the development or progression of AMD . Results from observational studies suggest that people who consume higher amounts of fatty fish and/or dietary LC omega-3s have a lower risk of developing AMD. In the cross-sectional EUREYE study of 2,275 participants age 65 years or older, those who ate fatty fish at least once per week had a 53% lower risk of neovascular AMD than those who consumed fatty fish less often . Results were similar in a study in 681 elderly male twins and an analysis of 38,022 healthy female health professionals . In the latter study, women in the highest tertiles of dietary DHA plus EPA intake (median of 330 mg/day) had a 38% lower risk of developing AMD during an average of 10 years of follow-up than those in those in the lowest tertile (median intake of 80 mg/day). Higher serum and erythrocyte membrane levels of EPA (but not DHA) have also been associated with a lower risk of neovascular AMD . In the AREDS clinical trial, a dietary supplement formulation containing 15 mg beta-carotene, 400 IU vitamin E, 500 mg vitamin C, 80 mg zinc, and 2 mg copper reduced the risk of advanced AMD in people with intermediate AMD or advanced AMD in one eye . Data from a nested cohort study within the AREDS population indicated that participants who reported the highest omega-3 intakes were about 30% less likely to develop central geographic atrophy and neovascular AMD than other participants . These findings, combined with other epidemiological evidence, formed the basis for the AREDS2 trial that examined whether adding 350 mg DHA and 650 mg EPA to the AREDS formulation further reduced the risk of progression to advanced AMD . The results showed that EPA and DHA did not provide any additional benefits after a median follow-up of 5 years. These findings are in line with those from a Cochrane Review that included the results from AREDS2 and the Nutritional AMD Treatment 2 study , a 3-year randomized clinical trial of LC omega-3 supplements (840 mg/day DHA and 270 mg/day EPA) in patients with early age-related maculopathy and neovascular AMD. The Cochrane Review authors concluded that LC omega-3 supplementation for up to 5 years in people with AMD does not reduce the risk of progression to advanced AMD or of moderate to severe vision loss. Dry eye disease About 14% of adults in the United States have dry eye disease, a chronic condition in which decreased tear volume and quality leads to ocular surface inflammation and damage, causing discomfort and visual impairment . Older women, in particular, have a higher risk of dry eye disease than other groups, possibly because of hormonal changes that affect the tear-producing glands . Researchers hypothesize that omega 3s—particularly EPA and DHA—might reduce the risk of dry eye disease and relieve its symptoms because of their anti-inflammatory activity, and many patients take them as adjunctive treatments to artificial tears and other medications. Some, but not all, observational studies show inverse associations between self-reported dietary consumption of omega-3s and risk of dry eye disease. For example, in a cross-sectional study of 32,470 women age 45–84 participating in the Women’s Health Study, those in the highest quintile of total dietary omega-3 intake (mean of 1,990 mg/day) had a 17% lower risk of dry eye disease than those in the lowest quintile (mean intake of 920 mg/day) . The study found a similar association for DHA—women in the highest versus the lowest quintiles of DHA intake had a 12% lower risk of dry eye disease; however, the results showed no significant associations for EPA. However, in another cross-sectional study of 322 postmenopausal women, total dietary omega-3 intakes were not correlated with the prevalence of dry eye disease . Results from clinical trials using omega-3 supplementation, primarily EPA and DHA, have had mixed results in reducing the symptoms and signs of dry eye disease. Furthermore, there is no consensus on the optimal dose, composition, or length of omega-3 treatment for this condition . The studies that have found beneficial effects from omega-3 supplementation for symptoms and signs of dry eye disease include one showing that daily supplementation with 1,000 mg omega-3s (650 mg EPA plus 350 mg DHA) for 3 months in 518 men and women (mean age about 40 years) living in northern India reduced symptoms and some signs of dry eye disease compared with placebo . In another clinical trial of 105 men and women, daily treatment with supplements containing 2,240 mg omega-3s (1,680 mg EPA and 560 mg DHA as re-esterified triglycerides) for 12 weeks also reduced symptoms of dry eye disease compared with placebo . In addition, the supplements increased tear break-up time and decreased tear osmolarity (which would be likely to reduce ocular surface damage). However, another large, randomized, double-blind clinical trial found that EPA and DHA from fish oil supplements are no better than placebo at relieving symptoms or signs of dry eye disease . This 12-month trial included 535 participants (about 81% female) age 18 years or older (mean age about 58 years) with at least a 6-month history of moderate to severe dry eye disease. Among them, 349 participants received daily supplements of 3,000 mg omega-3s (2,000 mg EPA plus 1,000 mg DHA), and 186 received a placebo containing 5,000 mg olive oil. Participants could continue taking medications for dry eyes, including artificial tears and prescription anti-inflammatory eye drops, as well as omega-3 supplements as long as the total dose of EPA plus DHA was less than 1,200 mg per day. At the end of the study, symptoms were less severe than at baseline in both groups, but the results showed no significant differences between groups. Groups also showed no significant differences compared with baseline in signs of dry eye disease, including conjunctive and cornea integrity as well as tear volume and quality. A subsequent clinical trial, an ancillary study of the VITAL trial described earlier, evaluated whether long-term daily supplementation with omega-3s prevents the development of dry eye disease in participants without the disease or not experiencing severe dry eye symptoms . A total of 23,523 men and women (50 and 55 years of age or older, respectively) received either a daily supplement of 1,000 mg omega-3s (460 mg EPA and 380 mg DHA) or a placebo for a median of 5.3 years. The supplement had no significant effects on the incidence of diagnosed dry eye disease or severe disease symptoms. Overall, the evidence to date shows no consistent relationship between omega-3s and dry eye disease. More research is warranted to fully understand whether increased intakes of dietary or supplemental omega-3s help reduce the risk of dry eye disease and whether they are beneficial as an adjunct treatment . Rheumatoid arthritis Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation of the joints. Its symptoms include pain, swelling, stiffness, and functional impairments. RA is typically treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs . Due to their anti-inflammatory effects, some scientists hypothesize that LC omega-3s reduce some of the symptoms of RA and patients' reliance on NSAIDs and corticosteroids. Several clinical trials, many conducted in the 1990s, have examined the use of LC omega-3 supplementation in patients with RA. These trials have generally shown that omega-3 supplements reduce patients' use of anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids, but that they do not have consistent effects on painful and/or tender joints, joint swelling, or morning stiffness [9,173-176]. For example, fish oil supplementation significantly reduced NSAID use in a controlled trial in Sweden . In this study, 43 patients with RA received either 10 g/day fish oil (containing 1.8 g EPA and 1.2 g DHA) or placebo along with their usual RA medications. NSAID use decreased in the treatment group at 3 and 6 months, and global arthritic activity assessed by physicians improved relative to placebo at 3 months. However, patient assessments of pain, morning stiffness, and functional capacity did not differ between groups. In a 2013 clinical trial in South Korea, 81 patients with RA received either LC omega-3s (2.1 g EPA and 1.2 g DHA) or a sunflower oil placebo daily for 16 weeks . Patients were allowed to continue taking NSAIDs, glucocorticoids, and/or antirheumatic drugs throughout the study. Compared to placebo, omega-3 supplementation had no significant effects on clinical symptoms of RA, including pain and morning stiffness. In post-hoc analysis, the researchers found that the supplements reduced the amount of NSAIDs needed, but only in patients weighing more than 55 kg. In a similar study in Denmark, 51 patients received either LC omega-3s (2.0 g EPA and 1.2 g DHA from fish oil) or placebo daily for 12 weeks, and they continued taking RA medications . Compared to placebo, morning stiffness, joint tenderness, and visual pain score decreased significantly in the treatment group. However, there were no significant differences between groups in grip strength, daily activity score, or joint swelling. The amounts of NSAIDs, aspirin, and acetaminophen that patients needed did not change in either group. Reviews and meta-analyses of studies that assessed whether fish oil and LC omega-3s are beneficial for RA have had inconsistent findings [9,173-176]. Some suggest that they do not significantly affect the clinical symptoms of RA but do reduce the amounts of NSAIDs and corticosteroids that patients need . Others indicate that LC omega-3s reduce joint swelling and pain, morning stiffness, and number of painful joints in addition to reducing NSAID use . Some researchers suggest that differences in findings could be due in part to whether patient-determined use of NSAIDs is considered a measure of pain . Findings to date suggest that LC omega-3s may be helpful as an adjunctive treatment to pharmacotherapy for ameliorating the symptoms of RA . However, more research is needed to confirm this finding. Other conditions The benefits of omega-3 supplementation are being investigated for several other conditions, including depression, inflammatory bowel disease, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), childhood allergies, and cystic fibrosis. A 2016 meta-analysis of 26 studies found a 17% lower risk of depression with higher fish intake . However, a 2015 Cochrane Review of 26 studies found insufficient evidence to determine whether omega-3s (1,000 to 6,600 mg/day EPA, DHA, and/or other omega-3s) are beneficial for major depressive disorder in adults . The authors did find a small-to-modest beneficial effect on depressive symptoms, but they concluded that this effect was not clinically significant. The authors of a systematic review of 19 randomized controlled trials concluded that the available evidence does not support the use of omega-3 supplements to treat active or inactive inflammatory bowel disease . Similarly, the authors of a Cochrane Review concluded that, based on the evidence from two large, high-quality studies, omega-3 supplements are probably not effective for maintaining remission in people who have Crohn's disease . A systematic review and meta-analysis of 10 studies in children with ADHD or related neurodevelopmental disorders, such as developmental coordination disorder, found no improvements with omega-3 supplementation on measures of emotional lability, oppositional behavior, conduct problems, or aggression . However, in subgroup analyses of only the higher quality studies and those with strict inclusion criteria, omega-3 supplementation (60 to 1,296 mg/day EPA and/or DHA) did significantly improve parent-rated emotional lability and oppositional behavior. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 10 prospective cohort studies and five randomized clinical trials on omega-3 intakes during pregnancy and outcomes of childhood allergic disease (eczema, rhino-conjunctivitis, and asthma) found inconsistent results . Although the authors could not draw firm conclusions due to the heterogeneity of the studies and their results, they concluded that the overall findings were suggestive of a protective association between higher maternal intakes of LC omega-3s or fish and incidence of allergic disease symptoms in the offspring. The authors of a Cochrane Review that included eight LC omega-3 supplementation trials concluded that there is limited evidence to support the use of LC omega-3 supplements by women during pregnancy and/or lactation for reducing the risk of allergic disease in their children . A Cochrane Review of four studies of cystic fibrosis found that omega-3 supplements (300 to 5,400 mg/day EPA and/or DHA) might improve lung function and increase blood levels of essential fatty acids in people with cystic fibrosis . However, the authors concluded that there is not enough evidence to recommend routine use of omega-3 supplements by people with cystic fibrosis. The potential benefits of omega-3s for these and other conditions require further study. Safety of Omega-3s For most macronutrients, the IOM has established an acceptable macronutrient distribution range (AMDR) that suggests an acceptable range of intake. The AMDR for total fat intake, for example, is based on adverse effects from either very low fat or very high fat diets. The IOM established an AMDR for omega-3s (as ALA) of 0.6% to 1.2% of energy for children and adults age 1 year and older . The IOM also noted that about 10% of the AMDR can be consumed as EPA and/or DHA. The IOM did not establish a UL for any omega-3s, although it noted that high doses of DHA and/or EPA (900 mg/day of EPA plus 600 mg/day DHA or more for several weeks) might reduce immune function due to suppression of inflammatory responses. Doses of 2–15 g/day EPA and/or DHA might also increase bleeding time by reducing platelet aggregation . However, according to the European Food Safety Authority, long-term consumption of EPA and DHA supplements at combined doses of up to about 5 g/day appears to be safe . It noted that these doses have not been shown to cause bleeding problems or affect immune function, glucose homeostasis, or lipid peroxidation. Similarly, FDA has concluded that dietary supplements providing no more than 5 g/day EPA and DHA are safe when used as recommended . Two large clinical trials completed after these assessments found that taking 4 g/day of omega-3 supplements for several years slightly increased the risk of atrial fibrillation in people with CVD or at high risk of CVD . Commonly reported side effects of omega-3 supplements are usually mild. These include unpleasant taste, bad breath, heartburn, nausea, gastrointestinal discomfort, diarrhea, headache, and odoriferous sweat . Interactions with Medications Omega-3 dietary supplements, such as fish oil, have the potential to interact with medications. One example is provided below. People taking these and other medications on a regular basis should discuss possible interactions with their health care providers. Warfarin (Coumadin) and similar anticoagulants Fish oil can have antiplatelet effects at high doses, although it appears to be less potent than aspirin . Fish oil might prolong clotting times, as indicated by an elevated international normalized ratio (INR), when it is taken with warfarin , but most research indicates that doses of 3–6 g/day fish oil do not significantly affect the anticoagulant status of patients taking warfarin . The authors of a 2014 review concluded that omega-3s do not affect the risk of clinically significant bleeding , and the FDA-approved package inserts for omega-3 pharmaceuticals state that studies with omega-3s have not produced \"clinically significant bleeding episodes\" . However, these package inserts also state that patients taking these products with anticoagulants should be monitored periodically for changes in INR. Omega-3s and Healthful Diets The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy)\". With respect to seafood and omega-3s, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans state that A healthy dietary pattern that consists of nutrient-dense forms of foods and beverages, including seafood, in recommended amounts and within calorie limits, supports health and helps minimize the risk of diet-related chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. Seafood intake during pregnancy is recommended, as it is associated with favorable measures of cognitive development in young children. Women who might become or are pregnant or breastfeeding should consume at least 8 and up to 12 ounces of a variety of seafood per week, from choices that are lower in methyl mercury. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding and young children should not eat certain types of fish that are high in methyl mercury. The recommendation to consume 8 or more ounces per week (less for young children) of seafood is for the total package of nutrients that seafood provides, including its EPA and DHA content. Some seafood choices with higher amounts of EPA and DHA should be included. Seafood varieties commonly consumed in the United States that are higher in EPA and DHA and lower in methyl mercury include salmon, anchovies, sardines, Pacific oysters, and trout. Tilapia, shrimp, catfish, crab, and flounder are commonly consumed varieties that also are lower in methyl mercury.

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet. Introduction The International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics defines probiotics as “live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host” . These microorganisms, which consist mainly of bacteria but also include yeasts, are present in some fermented foods (e.g., yogurt), are added to certain food products, and are available as dietary supplements. However, not all foods and dietary supplements that are labeled as probiotics have proven health benefits. Probiotics should not be confused with prebiotics, which are typically complex carbohydrates (such as inulin and other fructo-oligosaccharides) that microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract use as metabolic fuel . Commercial products containing both prebiotics and probiotic microorganisms are often called synbiotics. Probiotics should also not be confused with postbiotics, which are preparations comprised of dead, intact, or fragmented microorganisms, with or without their metabolites, that confer a health benefit on the host . Identification Probiotics are identified by their genus, species, and strain designation; some probiotics also receive subspecies names. Probiotic products often contain microbial organisms from the genera Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Escherichia, and Bacillus and from the family Lactobacillaceae. Probiotics are identified by their specific strain, which includes the genus, the species, the subspecies (if applicable), and an alphanumeric strain designation . Microbial organisms from the genera Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Escherichia, and Bacillus are commonly used in probiotic products. In addition, products commonly contain microbes from the family Lactobacillaceae, which includes several species that were formerly in the Lactobacillus genus before that genus was restructured in 2020 . When reporting the results from specific studies, this fact sheet maintains the original genus names that were in use at the time the research was conducted. Table 1 shows examples of the nomenclature used for several commercial strains of probiotic organisms. Table 1: Nomenclature for sample commercial strains of probiotics Lacticaseibacillus(formerly Lactobacillus): Species: rhamnosus, Subspecies: None, Strain Designation: GG, Strain Nickname: LGG Bifidobacterium: Species: animalis, Subspecies: lactis, Strain Designation: DN-173 010, Strain Nickname: Bifidus regularis Bifidobacterium: Species: longum, Subspecies: longum, Strain Designation: 35624, Strain Nickname: Bifantis Mechanisms of action Probiotics exert their health effects through a wide variety of mechanisms. Some of these mechanisms, such as inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract, are widely shared among probiotic strains. Other mechanisms are unique to a particular species or strain. The human gastrointestinal tract is colonized by many microorganisms, including bacteria, archaea, viruses, fungi, and protozoa. The activity and composition of these microorganisms (collectively known as the gut microbiota, microbiome, or intestinal microflora) can affect human health and disease. Probiotics are consumed orally and exert their effects in the gastrointestinal tract, where they may influence the intestinal microbiota. Probiotics may transiently colonize the human gut mucosa in highly individualized patterns, depending on the baseline microbiota, probiotic strain, and gastrointestinal tract region . Probiotics also exert health effects by nonspecific, species-specific, and strain-specific mechanisms. The nonspecific mechanisms vary widely among the strains, species, or even genera of commonly used probiotic supplements. These mechanisms include the inhibition of the growth of pathogenic microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract (by fostering colonization resistance, improving intestinal transit, producing antimicrobial substances, or helping normalize a perturbed microbiota), production of bioactive metabolites (e.g., short-chain fatty acids), and the reduction of luminal pH in the colon . Species-specific mechanisms can include vitamin synthesis, gut barrier reinforcement, bile salt metabolism, enzymatic activity, and toxin neutralization. Other mechanisms, such as cytokine production, specific immunomodulatory activities, and effects on the endocrine and nervous systems, are expressed in a strain-specific manner. Because the effects of probiotics can be specific to certain probiotic strains, recommendations for their use in the clinic need to be strain-specific . Additionally, researchers should take probiotic strains into account when designing studies and when pooling data from studies that may have used different probiotic strains to avoid misleading conclusions about their efficacy and safety. Sources of Probiotics Food Some types of fermented foods, such as yogurt, are potential sources of beneficial microbes, though not all fermented foods that contain live cultures have probiotic microorganisms. Probiotic microorganisms are also sometimes added to unfermented foods. Fermented foods are made through the growth and metabolic activity of a variety of live microbial cultures . Many of these foods are rich sources of live and potentially beneficial microbes. Some fermented foods, such as sourdough bread and most commercial pickles, are processed after they are fermented and do not contain live cultures when consumed. Yogurt, another type of fermented food, is made using Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Yogurt may also contain probiotic microorganisms from Bifidobacterium or Lactobacillaceae. Fermented foods that contain live cultures but do not typically contain proven probiotic microorganisms include many cheeses, kimchi (a Korean fermented cabbage dish), kombucha (a fermented tea), sauerkraut (fermented cabbage), miso (a fermented soybean-based paste), pickles, and raw unfiltered apple cider vinegar made from fermented apple sugars . Certain unfermented foods, such as milks, juices, smoothies, cereals, nutrition bars, and infant and toddler formulas, might be formulated with added probiotics. Typically, these probiotics are indicated on the label, with a strain designation and the number of viable microorganisms. Dietary supplements Dietary supplements that contain probiotics can include from one to many strains. The number of viable cells in a probiotic supplement is indicated by the number of colony-forming units (CFU) listed on the label. However, it can be difficult to determine which products offer verifiable health benefits due to the wide variety of probiotic strains and doses found in probiotic products and inconsistent labeling practices and recommendations for use. Probiotics are available as dietary supplements (in capsules, powders, liquids, and other forms) that contain a wide variety of strains and doses . Products can include single strains or multiple strains of live microorganisms. The effects of many commercial products that contain probiotics have not been examined in research studies, and it is difficult for people who are not familiar with probiotic research to determine which products are backed by evidence . However, some organizations have systematically reviewed the available evidence and developed recommendations for using specific probiotics—including the appropriate product, dose, and formulation—to prevent or treat various health conditions . Probiotics are measured in CFU, which indicate the number of viable cells. Amounts may be written on product labels as, for example, 1 x 109 for 1 billion CFU or 1 x 1010 for 10 billion CFU. Many probiotic supplements contain 1 to 10 billion CFU per dose, but some products contain 50 billion CFU or more. However, products with higher CFU counts are not necessarily more effective than products with a lower CFU count. Current labeling regulations only require manufacturers to list the total weight of the microorganisms on probiotic products’ Supplement Facts labels; this cellular mass can consist of both live and dead microorganisms and, therefore, has no relationship with the number of viable microorganisms in the product . Manufacturers may voluntarily list the CFU in a product in addition to the total microorganism weight on the Supplement Facts label. Because probiotics must be consumed alive to have health benefits and they can die during their shelf life, users should look for products labeled with the number of CFU at the end of the product’s shelf life, not at the time of manufacture. Probiotics and Health The potential health benefits of probiotics are the focus of a great deal of scientific research. This section focuses on eight health conditions: atopic dermatitis, pediatric acute infectious diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), hypercholesterolemia, and obesity. For information on probiotics and the common cold, influenza, and other respiratory tract infections, please see the Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) health professional fact sheet, Dietary Supplements for Immune Function and Infectious Diseases. Atopic dermatitis Studies have evaluated the use of various probiotic products to prevent atopic dermatitis, a common inflammatory skin disorder. The results of these studies suggest that probiotics may reduce the risk of developing atopic dermatitis and the severity of symptoms, though the relief these products can provide may be limited. Atopic dermatitis, the most common form of eczema, is also one of the most common chronic inflammatory skin disorders, affecting approximately 15% to 20% of children and 1% to 3% of adults worldwide . Numerous probiotic studies have evaluated the effects of various species and strains of bacteria on the prevention of atopic dermatitis, and several meta-analyses have synthesized the findings of these studies. These studies and meta-analyses show that exposure to probiotics during pregnancy and in early infancy might reduce the risk of developing atopic dermatitis in children. For example, a 2018 meta-analysis included 27 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and one controlled cohort study in a total of 6,907 infants and children who were exposed to probiotics in utero for 2 weeks to 7 months (via maternal oral supplementation) and/or by oral administration to the infants after birth for 2 to 13 months . The results showed that between age 6 months and 9 years, probiotic treatment with single strains or mixtures that included Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Propionibacterium strains significantly reduced the risk of atopic dermatitis from 34.7% in the control group to 28.5% in the probiotic group. Subgroup analyses showed that the use of probiotics during both the prenatal and postnatal periods significantly reduced the incidence of dermatitis; however, taking probiotics during only the prenatal or postnatal period did not. In addition, the effects of probiotic treatment varied by strain. For example, supplementation with either Lactobacillus rhamnosus or Lactobacillus paracasei significantly reduced the incidence of atopic dermatitis, whereas supplementation with Lactobacillus reuteri or Lactobacillus acidophilus did not. In contrast, another meta-analysis of five RCTs with a total of 889 participants found that Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) supplementation did not reduce the risk of eczema in children up to age 4 years, regardless of whether the children received probiotics directly or were exposed to probiotics in utero and/or during breastfeeding via maternal supplementation . Most published meta-analyses have shown that probiotics slightly reduce the severity of atopic dermatitis symptoms in infants and children. For example, a meta-analysis of 13 RCTs with a total of 1,070 participants age 18 years or younger found that probiotic treatment for 4 to 8 weeks significantly reduced SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) values, indicating reduced symptom severity . Subgroup analyses found that probiotics had protective effects in children age 1 to 18 years (nine trials) but not in infants younger than 1 year (five trials). In addition, treatment with Lactobacillus, Lactobacillus fermentum, or a mixture of probiotic strains significantly reduced SCORAD values in the children, whereas LGG and Lactobacillus plantarum had no effect. Another meta-analysis included eight RCTs with a total of 741 participants from birth to 36 months of age who were treated with Lactobacillus or Bifidobacterium for 4 to 24 weeks . Probiotics that contained Lactobacillus reduced the severity of atopic dermatitis symptoms in infants and toddlers, but those containing Bifidobacterium did not. In addition, the treatment significantly improved symptoms in participants with moderate-to-severe forms of the disease but not in those with mild forms. A Cochrane Review of 39 RCTs of single probiotics and probiotic mixtures that were used to treat eczema in 2,599 participants age 1 to 55 years (most were children) found that probiotic treatment might slightly reduce SCORAD scores . However, the researchers concluded that the differences were not clinically significant and that the current evidence does not support the use of probiotics for eczema treatment. Overall, the available evidence suggests that the use of probiotics might reduce the risk of developing atopic dermatitis and lead to significant reductions in atopic dermatitis SCORAD scores, but these products might provide only limited relief from the condition. Furthermore, the effects of probiotics vary by the strain used, the timing of administration, and the patient’s age, so it is difficult to make recommendations. Pediatric acute infectious diarrhea Some evidence supports using certain probiotics to manage acute infectious diarrhea in pediatric patients; a few reviews have shown that some probiotics reduce the duration of acute diarrhea. However, not all trials concur with these results, and it is unclear whether probiotic supplements are an effective method for managing this condition in developed countries. Acute diarrhea is usually defined as loose or liquid stools and/or an increase in the frequency of bowel movements (typically at least three in 24 hours) . Acute diarrhea can be accompanied by fever or vomiting, and it usually lasts no more than 7 days. A 2020 Cochrane Review that included 82 RCTs with a total of 12,127 participants (primarily children) reported a reduction of 36% in the risk of diarrhea that lasted 48 hours or more in people who received probiotics compared with those who did not . Probiotics also reduced the mean duration of diarrhea by 21.3 hours. However, the authors noted that there was significant heterogeneity between the included studies, and when they included only studies that had a low risk of bias in their analysis, they found no difference between groups for the risk of diarrhea that lasted 48 hours or more or for the duration of diarrhea. An assessment of 11 RCTs with a total of 2,444 participants showed that LGG is most effective in treating infectious diarrhea at a daily dose of at least 1010 CFU . A review of 22 RCTs and non-randomized trials with a total of 2,440 participants age 1 month to 15 years found that administering Saccharomyces boulardii (most commonly 109 to 1010 CFU/day for 5–10 days) reduced both the duration of diarrhea and stool frequency . In both of these analyses, LGG and Saccharomyces boulardii reduced the duration of acute infectious diarrhea by approximately 1 day. However, two subsequent clinical trials found that a 5-day course of LGG (1 x 1010 CFU twice per day taken alone in one trial and a total of 4 x 109 CFU twice per day of LGG and Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 in the other) was no better than placebo at treating or improving the outcomes of acute gastroenteritis in 1,729 infants and young children who presented to pediatric emergency departments . Recent studies suggest that probiotics might not be efficacious in emergency departments in developed countries because most episodes of acute infectious diarrhea are self-limiting and require no treatment other than rehydration therapy . Therefore, the cost-effectiveness of using probiotic supplements to manage acute viral diarrhea lacks consensus . In 2023, the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) Working Group on Probiotics and Prebiotics issued updated versions of their recommendations for using probiotics to manage specific gastrointestinal disorders in children, including acute gastroenteritis . The Working Group reported that there is evidence that LGG, Saccharomyces boulardii, Limosilactobacillus reuteri, and the combination of Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus and Limosilactobacillus reuteri can reduce the duration of diarrhea; therefore, they recommend the use of specific doses and durations of these probiotics in pediatric patients with acute gastroenteritis. However, the grade of recommendation for each of these probiotics was weak, and the certainty of evidence for each was low or very low. In contrast, the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) recommended against the use of probiotics in children with acute infectious gastroenteritis in the United States and Canada in their 2020 technical review . In this review, most of the studies that showed a benefit were performed in India, Italy, Poland, Turkey, and Pakistan, and the review authors cited concerns about the risk of bias in these studies. The few studies that were conducted in the United States and Canada reported no benefits. Antibiotic-associated diarrhea Antibiotics can disrupt the intestinal microbiome, and people who are taking antibiotics are at risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). Some systematic reviews and meta-analyses report that starting certain probiotic treatments within 2 days of the first antibiotic dose helps reduce the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in specific patient populations. Antibiotics are another common cause of acute-onset diarrhea. By decreasing microbial diversity, antibiotic treatment often disturbs the intestinal microbiome and can lead to a loss of microbial metabolism (resulting in osmotic diarrhea due to excessive fluid in the intestine), loss of colonization resistance (resulting in increased numbers of infections by other pathogens), and increased intestinal motility . Up to 30% of patients who use antibiotics experience AAD . Individuals who are receiving inpatient care are at significantly greater risk of developing AAD than those who are receiving outpatient care. Similarly, children younger than 2 years and seniors older than 65 years are at greater risk of developing AAD than other children and adults. Some antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, penicillin) are associated with AAD more often than others . Meta-analyses indicate that the use of any of a few species and strains of probiotics might reduce the risk of AAD by 51% . However, the benefits of using probiotics to prevent AAD depend on the type of antibiotic that caused the AAD, the strain(s) of probiotic used, the life stage of the user (i.e., child, younger adult, older adult), and whether the user is receiving inpatient or outpatient care. The use of probiotics has been associated with a reduced risk of AAD in children and adults age 18 to 64 years but not in adults age 65 years and older . Both LGG and Saccharomyces boulardii have been shown to reduce the risk of AAD. In a systematic review and meta-analysis of 12 RCTs that included a total of 1,499 children and adults, treatment with 4 x 108 to 12 x 1010 CFU LGG for 10 days to 3 months reduced the risk of AAD in patients who were treated with antibiotics from 22.4% to 12.3% . However, when the 445 children and 1,052 adults were evaluated separately, the difference was only statistically significant in children. Although the optimal dose of LGG is unclear, 1 to 2 x 1010 CFU/day reduced the risk of AAD in children by 71% . Taking probiotics within 2 days of the first antibiotic dose is more effective than starting to take them later. In a systematic review and meta-analysis of 21 RCTs that enrolled a total of 4,780 adults and children (who were mostly between 6 months and 65 years of age), treatment with Saccharomyces boulardii reduced the risk of AAD in adults who were treated with antibiotics from 17.4% to 8.2% when compared with placebo or no treatment . Among the children, Saccharomyces boulardii reduced the risk from 20.9% to 8.8%. Various doses of Saccharomyces boulardii were tested, and no clear dose-dependent effects were observed. A 2023 position paper from the ESPGHAN Working Group on Probiotics and Prebiotics recommends administering doses of 5 x 109 CFU/day or more of LGG or Saccharomyces boulardii starting simultaneously with antibiotics to prevent AAD in nonhospitalized and hospitalized children who have risk factors for AAD, such as the presence of comorbidities . Overall, the available evidence suggests that starting probiotic treatment with LGG or Saccharomyces boulardii within 2 days of the first antibiotic dose helps reduce the risk of AAD in children and adults age 18 to 64. There is no evidence to suggest that the benefits are greater when more than one probiotic strain is used. Necrotizing enterocolitis Researchers have evaluated whether specific combinations of probiotics can reduce the severe inflammatory responses seen in preterm infants with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Probiotic products are sometimes used in hospital settings to reduce the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has raised concerns that administering probiotics to preterm infants may cause adverse effects. NEC is a life-threatening gastrointestinal illness that mostly affects preterm infants within the first few weeks of birth. NEC occurs when an imbalance in the communities of bacteria in the intestine provokes an inflammatory response from the body; the resulting inflammation can destroy the cells that line the intestine. The risk of NEC is especially high in preterm infants with very low birth weight (i.e., those weighing <1,500 g [3.3 pounds]) . Infants who recover from NEC may have long-lasting health problems, including short bowel syndrome, parenteral nutrition-associated liver injury, and developmental delays. Certain probiotics can block the signaling pathways in the cells of the intestine that respond to bacterial invaders . This can potentially protect the intestine by reducing the inflammatory response. Other probiotics may strengthen the gut barrier, reducing the risk of bacterial translocation and sepsis [40-43]. Thus, researchers have investigated the use of probiotics to prevent NEC in preterm infants, and probiotic products are sometimes used in hospital settings to reduce the risk of NEC [44-46]. In a 2020 AGA technical review, the authors analyzed the results of 63 trials that evaluated the use of single-strain and multi-strain probiotics in a total of 15,712 preterm infants (<37 weeks gestational age) . The review found that administering specific combinations of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains reduced the risk of all-cause mortality, the risk of severe NEC, and the number of days to reach full enteral feeds in these infants when compared with placebo. The results of this review informed AGA’s clinical practice guidelines for probiotics, in which AGA recommends using specific combinations of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains in preterm, low-birth-weight infants to prevent NEC . In addition, the World Health Organization published guidelines in 2023 for the care of preterm or low birth weight infants . Their guidelines state that probiotics may be considered for human-milk-fed preterm infants who are born before 32 weeks gestation. Also in 2023, a systematic review of 90 trials in preterm infants found that multi-strain probiotics reduce the risk of all-cause mortality, severe NEC, and feeding intolerance; multi-strain probiotics also reduce the time needed to reach full enteral feeds and the duration of hospitalization . However, a Cochrane Review stated that the available evidence for using probiotics in very preterm infants born before 32 weeks gestation and very low birth weight infants who weigh less than 1,500 g at birth is inconclusive and called for more research in this population . In their 2023 position paper, the ESPGHAN Working Group on Probiotics and Prebiotics revisited their 2020 recommendations for using probiotics to prevent NEC in preterm infants and concluded that no changes to the 2020 recommendations were needed . They continue to recommend using either LGG (1 to 6 × 109 CFU) or the combination of Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium lactis, and Streptococcus thermophilus (3.0 to 3.5 × 108 CFU for each strain) to reduce the risk of NEC in preterm infants. However, they stated that the grade of this recommendation is weak and the certainty of evidence is low. In addition, they noted that all safety and quality issues must be addressed, such as the potential for probiotic sepsis in preterm infants and the fact that probiotic products might not be labeled with the correct strains . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a news release in 2023 informing the public, including health care providers, that administering probiotics to preterm infants may cause infection or invasive and potentially fatal disease . FDA reported that probiotics have been associated with one infant death and more than two dozen other adverse events in recent years, and the agency reiterated the fact that probiotics have not undergone FDA’s premarket process to evaluate their safety, effectiveness, and quality for medical uses. The agency called for more rigorous clinical trials to provide better evidence for using probiotics in infants. Inflammatory bowel disease Alterations to the gut microbiome may play a role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and researchers are evaluating whether probiotics can help manage this chronic condition. The results have been mixed; studies have reported that certain probiotics might provide some benefits to people with ulcerative colitis but not to those with Crohn’s disease. Clinical practice guidelines do not specifically recommend the use of probiotics in people with IBD. IBD is a chronic inflammatory disease that includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease . The exact cause of IBD is unknown, but it is probably a combination of inherited and environmental factors, including genetic alterations and immune system dysfunction . Various treatments for IBD, including oral steroids and other medications, are available, but no cure exists. Researchers are exploring whether individuals with IBD have alterations in the gut microbiome and whether probiotics might help manage IBD . Several reviews have assessed the effects of probiotics on IBD [31,47,53-56]. The authors of all of these reviews reached similar conclusions—that certain probiotics might have modestly beneficial effects on ulcerative colitis but not Crohn’s disease. A 2020 systematic review from AGA examined the role of probiotics in managing gastrointestinal disorders . The review included 12 trials that used probiotics to induce or maintain remission in 689 children and adults with Crohn’s disease as well as 17 trials that examined the use of various probiotic formulations to induce or maintain remission in 1,673 children and adults with ulcerative colitis. The trials used various probiotic strains and combinations—including Saccharomyces boulardii, LGG, Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC 533, Escherichia coli Nissle 1917, and an eight-strain combination product called VSL#3—for several months. The results provided no evidence that probiotics help induce or maintain remission in children or adults with Crohn’s disease. The authors could not draw conclusions about whether probiotics benefit patients with severe ulcerative colitis or are effective alternatives to existing therapies. However, there is some evidence to suggest that these supplements might modestly reduce disease activity in individuals with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis when combined with conventional therapies. The results of this review are limited by the differences between the studies, including different patient populations, probiotic formulations, treatment durations, and concomitant therapies. A 2020 Cochrane Review of 14 studies that enrolled a total of 865 participants with ulcerative colitis also indicated that probiotics may help induce remission and that combining probiotics with 5-ASA (an anti-inflammatory medication commonly used to treat IBD) may be superior to using 5-ASA alone . However, the evidence was limited and of low certainty. A similar 2020 Cochrane Review of 12 studies in 1,473 participants with ulcerative colitis examined whether probiotics can help maintain remission . The authors concluded that the effects of products are uncertain because of the small number of participants in the studies and the unreliable methodologies used. An AGA clinical decision support tool makes no recommendation on the use of probiotics in adults and children with IBD due to knowledge gaps . Similarly, in a clinical practice guideline on the role of probiotics in managing gastrointestinal disorders, AGA recommends using probiotics in adults and children with ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease only in the context of a clinical trial . Consensus guidelines published by the British Society of Gastroenterology in 2019 addressed the management of IBD, including the use of probiotics . The authors concluded that although probiotics may be modestly beneficial for people with ulcerative colitis, they should not be routinely used. For people with Crohn’s disease, the authors found no evidence of any benefit. In 2023, the ESPGHAN Working Group on Probiotics and Prebiotics stated that there was not enough evidence to recommend for or against the use of probiotics in children with ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease . Additional research, including well-powered RCTs, is needed to identify which patients with IBD might benefit from probiotics and which probiotic strains are most effective . Irritable bowel syndrome In people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), populations of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium decrease as populations of proinflammatory bacterial species increase. Certain probiotic products have the potential to restore some missing microbial functionality and help manage the symptoms of this condition. IBS is a common functional disorder of the gastrointestinal tract that is characterized by recurrent abdominal discomfort or pain, bloating, and changes in stool form or frequency. Although the causes of IBS are not completely understood, growing evidence suggests potential roles for intestinal microbiota in its pathophysiology and symptoms; IBS has also been linked to stress . According to this research, proinflammatory bacterial species, including Enterobacteriaceae, are abundant in patients with IBS, who typically also have a corresponding reduction in the amounts of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium in the gastrointestinal tract . Probiotic products commonly contain Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium and, therefore, have the potential to restore some missing microbial functionality and, consequently, help manage IBS symptoms. Several meta-analyses have assessed the role of probiotics in patients with IBS [62-66]. Most have found that probiotics have a positive, although modest, beneficial effect. For example, a meta-analysis of 23 RCTs in a total of 2,575 patients found that, overall, probiotics reduced the risk that IBS symptoms would persist or not improve by 21% . Various species and strains of probiotics had beneficial effects on global IBS symptoms, abdominal pain, bloating, and flatulence scores, but the quality of the studies was low. Some combinations of probiotics were superior to individual strains in this analysis, but no specific combination was superior to another. A second meta-analysis of 15 RCTs in a total of 1,793 patients with IBS found that probiotics reduced the severity of overall symptoms and abdominal pain more than placebo after 8 to 10 weeks of therapy; in children, these supplements also improved mucosal barrier function . A more recent systematic review included 35 RCTs of 16 single-strain and 19 multi-strain products in 3,406 adults with IBS . Of the studies that found a statistically significant reduction in global symptoms (14 of 29 trials) or a clinically meaningful reduction in abdominal pain (8 of 34 trials), most used multi-strain probiotic products. Furthermore, only trials of multi-strain products found a clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life . Whether different strains of probiotic bacteria have beneficial effects in people with IBS probably depends on the IBS symptom being evaluated . In a meta-analysis of 10 RCTs that enrolled a total of 877 adults who were treated with probiotics or placebo for 4 weeks to 6 months, people who received probiotics that contained Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium longum, or Lactobacillus acidophilus species had lower pain scores than those who received placebo . In contrast, Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus, Bifidobacterium animalis, Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and Saccharomyces boulardii had no significant effect. Flatulence declined with the use of all tested probiotics, and the abdominal distension scores improved with the use of probiotics that contained Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus casei, or Lactobacillus plantarum species. The authors noted that, overall, the studies showed no clear positive effect of probiotics on quality of life. The available evidence indicates that probiotics might reduce some symptoms of IBS. However, additional high-quality clinical trials are needed to confirm the specific strain, dose, and duration of treatment required as well as the type of IBS (such as with predominant diarrhea or constipation) that can be treated effectively with probiotics. Hypercholesterolemia Some studies have suggested that taking combinations of certain probiotic strains may improve lipid profiles. Specifically, the use of specific probiotics may reduce total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. However, study results have been mixed, and more research is needed. High levels of cholesterol in the blood or cholesterol trapped in arterial walls are risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) carries cholesterol to tissues and arteries. The higher the LDL level, the greater the risk is for CVD. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) carries cholesterol from the tissues to the liver and leads to its excretion. A low level of HDL increases a person’s risk of CVD. Researchers have studied the use of probiotics to improve lipid profiles. The mechanisms of their effects on cholesterol concentrations include catabolism of cholesterol by increasing: Bile salt hydrolase activity, which increases the need for new bile acids and thus reduces serum cholesterol levels [70-72] The binding of cholesterol in the small intestine, which reduces the amount that the body absorbs The assimilation and incorporation of cholesterol into bacteria , thus lowering cholesterol levels in blood The production of short-chain fatty acids by lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, which lowers hepatic cholesterol synthesis and regulates cholesterol metabolism [70-73] Bile salt hydrolase activity, which increases the need for new bile acids and thus reduces serum cholesterol levels [70-72] The binding of cholesterol in the small intestine, which reduces the amount that the body absorbs The assimilation and incorporation of cholesterol into bacteria , thus lowering cholesterol levels in blood The production of short-chain fatty acids by lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, which lowers hepatic cholesterol synthesis and regulates cholesterol metabolism [70-73] A meta-analysis of 30 RCTs with 1,624 participants (mostly adults age 18 years or older) found that administering probiotics for 3 to 12 weeks reduced total cholesterol concentrations by a mean of 7.8 mg/dL and reduced LDL concentrations by a mean of 7.3 mg/dL compared with placebo . In subgroup analyses, the benefits of probiotics were slightly greater in studies that lasted 8 weeks or longer and in participants who had baseline total cholesterol levels higher than 240 mg/dL. Among the strains included in more than three studies, Lactobacillus acidophilus, a mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium lactis, and Lactobacillus plantarum were associated with significant reductions in total and LDL cholesterol concentrations, but Lactobacillus helveticus and Enterococcus faecium were not. In a smaller meta-analysis of 11 RCTs in 602 adults with normal or high cholesterol levels, those treated with probiotics for 2 to 10 weeks had 6.6 mg/dL lower total cholesterol and 8.5 mg/dL lower LDL cholesterol levels than those treated with placebo, but the probiotic treatment had no significant effects on HDL cholesterol levels . The effects were most pronounced in people who consumed probiotics for more than 4 weeks, in those with hypercholesterolemia, and in those age 45 or older. In both meta-analyses, participants included both healthy adults and adults with hypercholesterolemia, CVD, diabetes, or obesity. However, the authors of a more recent review of the influence of probiotics on the blood lipid profiles of healthy adults (in 14 studies with a total of 942 adults treated for 15–150 days) found insufficient evidence to conclude that probiotics improve blood lipid levels . Another review found that the use of probiotics that contained multiple strains produced statistically significant reductions in total and LDL cholesterol levels (by 12.0 and 20.1 mg/dL, respectively), whereas trials that used a single strain did not . Overall, research suggests that using a combination of multiple probiotic strains as well as probiotics that contain Lactobacillus acidophilus, a mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium lactis, or Lactobacillus plantarum might reduce total and LDL cholesterol levels. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings. Obesity The microbes of the intestinal tract help extract nutrients and energy from food, which suggests a role for probiotics in the management of body weight. However, while some of the clinical trials that have evaluated the impact of probiotics on obesity-related endpoints have reported promising results, others have reported no effects. The gut microbiota play an important role in nutrient and energy extraction from food. Research in mice suggests that the gut microbiota affect not only the use of energy from the diet, but also energy expenditure and storage within the host . Whether these effects translate to humans is unknown. The results of clinical trials that have assessed the impact of probiotics on obesity-related endpoints have been inconsistent. One 12-week clinical trial, for example, randomized 210 healthy adults age 35 to 60 years who had large amounts of visceral fat to consume 200 g/day of fermented milk that contained 107, 106, or 0 (control) CFU of Lactobacillus gasseri SBT2055 (LG2055) per gram of milk . Participants who received 107 or 106 CFU/g milk of Lactobacillus gasseri experienced significant reductions in visceral fat area (mean reductions of 8.5% and 8.2%, respectively), body mass index, waist and hip circumference, and body fat mass compared with the control group. In an RCT, daily supplementation with 3.24 x 108 CFU Lactobacillus rhamnosus CGMCC1.3724 for 24 weeks combined with an energy-restricted diet for the first 12 weeks (500 kcal/day less than estimated calorie needs) did not significantly affect weight loss compared with placebo in 125 adults with obesity . However, among female participants, those who received Lactobacillus had greater reductions in body weight after 12 weeks (loss of 1.8 kg) and 24 weeks (loss of 2.6 kg) than those who received placebo. A 2017 systematic review of 14 clinical trials, including the two described above, in 1,067 individuals with overweight or obesity showed that probiotics (mostly Lactobacillus administered at various doses for 3 weeks to 6 months) significantly decreased body weight and/or body fat in nine trials, had no effect in three trials, and increased body weight in two trials . Another recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 15 RCTs in 957 individuals with overweight or obesity found that supplementation with various doses and strains of probiotics for 3 to 12 weeks resulted in larger reductions in body weight (by 0.6 kg), body mass index (by 0.27 kg/m2), and fat percentage (by 0.6%) than placebo . However, these effects were small and of questionable clinical significance. In contrast, a more recent systematic review and meta-analysis, which included 19 randomized trials in 1,412 participants, found that supplementation with probiotics or synbiotics reduced waist circumference slightly (by 0.82 cm) but had no effect on body weight or body mass index, although the quality of evidence was low to moderate . The findings from another meta-analysis of 14 trials in 881 adults, 5 trials in 726 children, and 12 trials in 1,154 infants suggested that probiotics promote the loss of a mean of 0.54 kg in adults, the gain of a mean of 0.20 kg in children, and no significant weight loss or gain in infants . Taken together, these results indicate that the effects of probiotics on body weight and obesity might depend on several factors, including the probiotic strain, dose, and duration, as well as certain characteristics of the user, including age, sex, and baseline body weight. Additional research is needed to understand the potential effects of probiotics on body fat, body weight, and obesity in humans. Safety Considerations Probiotics are unlikely to cause harm in healthy people, and side effects are usually minor. However, the use of probiotics has been linked to a few cases of bacteremia, fungemia, and infections that have resulted in severe illness; most of these cases involved individuals who were severely ill or immunocompromised. Many probiotic strains derive from species with a long history of safe use in foods or from microorganisms that colonize healthy gastrointestinal tracts. For these reasons, common probiotics—such as Bifidobacterium and members of the Lactobacillaceae family—are unlikely to cause harm in healthy people . Side effects of probiotics are usually minor and consist of self-limited gastrointestinal symptoms, such as gas. However, some clinical trials of probiotics are not designed to adequately address questions about safety, leaving gaps in available safety evidence [85-87]. Moreover, some evidence indicates that probiotics may cause harm in certain populations, including people who are severely ill or immunocompromised. The 2023 FDA press release discussed above expressed concerns about the potential risks of administering probiotics to preterm infants . The use of probiotics has been linked to bacteremia, fungemia (fungi in the blood), or infections that have resulted in severe illness in some cases, most of which involved individuals who were severely ill or immunocompromised . However, some case reports did not confirm that the specific strain of probiotics used was the cause of the infection. In other cases, the probiotic strain was confirmed to be the opportunistic pathogen. Because the species used as probiotics can also be normal residents of a patient’s microbiota, such confirmation is important. At least 60 reports have been published since 1966 of fungemia associated with the use of probiotics that contain the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In many of these cases, the patients were in an intensive care unit (ICU), were receiving enteral or parenteral nutrition, had a central venous catheter, or had received broad-spectrum antimicrobial treatment . When LGG was introduced into dairy products in Finland in 1990, monitoring of this country’s population through 2000 revealed no increase in the rates of bacteremia (bacteria in the blood) caused by Lactobacillus species . However, a retrospective analysis of 22,174 ICU patients in a Boston hospital found that those who received LGG (typically through a feeding tube) had a markedly higher risk of developing Lactobacillus bacteremia compared to patients who did not receive the probiotic . Of the 522 patients who received LGG, a genome-level analysis identified six cases where the ingested LGG was found in the blood, compared to only two cases among the 21,652 patients who did not receive the LGG. For individuals with compromised immune function or other serious underlying diseases, the World Gastroenterology Organisation (WGO) advises restricting probiotic use to the strains and indications that have proven efficacy Probiotic Selection and Use There are currently no formal recommendations for or against the use of probiotics in healthy people. However, some expert bodies of health professionals provide guidance on the use of specific probiotic strains in people with certain health conditions. These groups also offer guidance for clinicians and consumers on choosing probiotic products. Expert bodies of health professionals make no recommendations for or against the use of probiotics by healthy people. For people with various health conditions, however, published studies and reviews provide some guidance (as described above) on probiotic species, strains, and doses that might alleviate their symptoms. The WGO notes that the optimal dose of probiotics depends on the strain and product and recommends that clinicians only advise their patients to use probiotic strains, doses, and durations that have been shown to be beneficial in human studies . The WGO guidelines include a summary of the evidence on specific probiotic strains used in studies for specific gastrointestinal endpoints . Finally, the WGO recommends that probiotic supplement users check the labels of probiotic supplements for recommended storage conditions; for example, some require refrigeration, whereas others can be stored at room temperature. The International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics advises manufacturers to list the total number of CFU—ideally for each strain—through the expiration date or use-by date on the product label . The association also suggests that consumers of these supplements avoid products that list the number of CFU at time of manufacture because this information does not account for declines in CFU over a product’s lifespan.

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet. Introduction Zinc, an essential mineral, is naturally present in some foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement. Zinc is also found in some cold lozenges, over-the-counter drugs sold as cold remedies, and some denture adhesive creams. Zinc is involved in many aspects of cellular metabolism. It is required for the catalytic activity of hundreds of enzymes, and it plays a role in enhancing immune function, protein and DNA synthesis, wound healing, and cell signaling and division [1-4]. Zinc also supports healthy growth and development during pregnancy, infancy, childhood, and adolescence and is involved in the sense of taste . The total amount of zinc in the body is approximately 1.5 g in women and 2.5 g in men . Most of this zinc is stored in skeletal muscle and bone [1-3]. The processes that maintain zinc homeostasis are absorption of zinc from the diet, excretion into the gastrointestinal tract, and reabsorption in the gastrointestinal lumen . In general, as zinc intakes rise, the amount of zinc absorbed also increases, but its fractional absorption drops . Serum or plasma zinc levels are typically used in clinical practice to assess zinc status. In healthy people, the amount of zinc in serum or plasma is 80 to 120 mcg/dL (12 to 18 mcmol/L) . Serum zinc levels below 70 mcg/dL in women and 74 mcg/dL in men indicate inadequate zinc status. However, both serum and plasma measures have important limitations. Zinc concentrations in serum are associated with the patient’s sex and age as well as the time of the blood draw (morning vs. evening) and do not always correlate with dietary or supplemental zinc intakes . Zinc levels also fluctuate in response to other factors, including infections, changes in steroid hormones, and muscle catabolism during weight loss or illness . Clinicians consider risk factors (such as inadequate caloric intake, chronic alcohol use, and malabsorptive digestive diseases) and signs of zinc deficiency (such as impaired growth in infants and children) when they assess a patient’s zinc status . Recommended Intakes Intake recommendations for zinc and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine . DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following: Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects Table 1: Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for Zinc Birth to 6 months*: Male: 2 mg, Female: 2 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  7–12 months: Male: 3 mg, Female: 3 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  1–3 years: Male: 3 mg, Female: 3 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  4–8 years: Male: 5 mg, Female: 5 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  9–13 years: Male: 8 mg, Female: 8 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  14–18 years: Male: 11 mg, Female: 9 mg, Pregnancy: 12 mg, Lactation: 13 mg 19+ years: Male: 11 mg, Female: 8 mg, Pregnancy: 11 mg, Lactation: 12 mg *Adequate Intake (AI), equivalent to the mean intake of zinc in healthy, breastfed infants. Sources of Zinc Food The richest food sources of zinc include meat, fish, and seafood . Oysters contain more zinc per serving than any other food, but beef contributes 20% of zinc intakes from food in the United States because it is commonly consumed . Eggs and dairy products also contain zinc . Beans, nuts, and whole grains contain zinc, but the bioavailability of zinc from these foods is lower than that from animal foods because these foods contain phytates. Phytates, the storage form of phosphorus in plants, bind some minerals such as zinc in the intestine and form an insoluble complex that inhibits zinc absorption [1-3,8]. Fruits and vegetables contain very little zinc. Breakfast cereals, which are often fortified with zinc, are a major source of zinc in the U.S. diet . In U.S. children and adolescents, 12.1% to 18.4% of daily zinc intakes come from enriched and fortified foods . The amount of zinc absorbed from food ranges from 5% to more than 50%, depending on the amount of plant-based foods (and thus of phytate) in the diet . The absorption of zinc from mixed meals or diets containing a combination of animal-based and plant-based foods is lower than from diets or meals containing animal-based foods only . Table 2 lists a variety of foods and their zinc content per serving .

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for zinc is 11 mg for adults and children age 4 years and older . FDA does not require food labels to list zinc content unless zinc has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA's) FoodData Central lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides a comprehensive list of foods containing zinc arranged by nutrient content and by food name. Dietary supplements Zinc is available in supplements containing only zinc; supplements containing zinc in combination with other ingredients; and in many multivitamin/mineral products . Supplements can contain any of a variety of forms of zinc, including zinc sulfate, zinc acetate, and zinc gluconate . The Supplement Facts panel on a dietary supplement label declares the amount of elemental zinc in the product, not the weight of the entire zinc-containing compound. Absorption of zinc from supplements containing zinc citrate or zinc gluconate is similar, at approximately 61% in young adults; the absorption from supplements containing zinc oxide is 50% . Taking supplements containing 25 mg elemental iron or more at the same time as zinc supplements can reduce zinc absorption and plasma zinc concentrations [16-19]. However, the iron added to enriched or fortified foods does not interfere with zinc absorption. Other sources Products containing zinc include some labeled as homeopathic medications as well as nasal sprays that are sold over the counter to treat or prevent the common cold, manage flu symptoms, and support immune system health. Some denture adhesive creams contain 17–34 mg/g zinc to enhance their adhesive properties . Use as directed, resulting in intakes of 0.5–1.5 g zinc from these products per day, is not a concern. However, chronic, excessive use can lead to zinc toxicity, which can cause copper deficiency and neurologic diseases. Such toxicity has been reported in individuals who use at least one tube containing a total of 2.4 g or more denture cream each week for several years [21-23]. Many denture creams have been reformulated to omit zinc. Zinc Intakes and Status Most people in the United States consume adequate amounts of zinc, but people in certain age groups, especially older adults, might have marginal intakes. The average daily zinc intake from foods is 7.6–9.7 mg/day in children age 2–11 years, 10.1 mg/day in children and teens age 12–19 years, 13 mg/day in men older than 19, and 9.2 mg/day in women . The average daily zinc intake from foods and supplements is 8.4–10.4 mg/day in children age 2–11 years, 10.7 mg/day in children and teens age 12–19 years, 16.4 mg/day in men, and 12.6 mg/day in women. In pregnant women age 20–40 years, the mean zinc intake is 12.4 mg/day from foods alone and 22.7 mg/day from foods and supplements . Less than 1% of U.S. children age 2 to 8 years have zinc intakes from foods and supplements that are lower than the EAR. Among boys age 14 to 18 years, 1% have intakes below the EAR . However, the proportion is much higher, 20.9%, in girls in this age group. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2005 to 2016 show that among U.S. adults age 19 years and older, 15% have zinc intakes below the EAR . In the United States, 3.8% of children younger than 10, 8.6% of males age 10 and older, and 8.2% of females have serum zinc concentrations below the serum zinc cutoff for sufficiency for their age and sex according to an analysis of 2011–2014 NHANES data . The investigators used cutoffs developed by the Biomarkers of Nutrition for Development Zinc Expert Panel on the basis of a statistical definition: 57–65 mcg/dL for children younger than 10, 69–70 mcg/dL for females age 10 and older, and 61–74 mcg/dL for males age 10 and older . Zinc deficiency based on serum or plasma concentrations is much more common in low-income and middle-income countries . According to an estimate based on analyses of zinc and phytate available in national food supplies and the prevalence of stunting, approximately 17% of the world’s population is likely to have zinc deficiency . Zinc Deficiency Because zinc has many functions throughout the body, zinc deficiency affects many different tissues and organs . Zinc deficiency can affect, for example, skin; bones; and the digestive, reproductive, central nervous, and immune systems . The manifestations of zinc deficiency vary by age . In infants and children, diarrhea is a common sign. In older children, alopecia, delayed growth, and frequent infections become more prevalent. In both infants and children, zinc deficiency can impair growth and lead to a loss of appetite and reproductive problems when they reach adulthood . In populations with low intakes of absorbable zinc (e.g., from meat and fish), including many low-income and middle-income countries, zinc deficiency affects the health of pregnant women and their infants by increasing the risk of child morbidity (including premature birth and low birthweight) and mortality, maternal morbidity, and adverse birth outcomes . In addition, zinc deficiency can interfere with the senses of taste and smell . Zinc deficiency in older adults can cause delays in wound healing and changes in cognitive and psychological function . Groups at Risk of Zinc Inadequacy The following groups are among those most likely to have inadequate zinc status. People with gastrointestinal disorders or who have had bariatric surgery Zinc inadequacy is common in people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD, which includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease) or bariatric surgery involving resection of the gastrointestinal tract because of poor dietary intakes, decreased absorption, or increased urinary excretion as a result of inflammation . Approximately 15% to 40% of people with IBD have zinc deficiency during active disease states and while in remission . In patients with zinc deficiency, the risk of IBD-related symptoms (including anemia, hemorrhage, and abdominal or perianal fistula) increases, and these patients are more likely to need hospitalization or surgery. Zinc supplementation might reduce these risks . Approximately 50% of people with newly diagnosed celiac disease have a high risk of zinc inadequacy or deficiency; potential contributors to this risk might include zinc malabsorption and mucosal inflammation . These deficiencies sometimes persist even when people with celiac disease avoid foods containing gluten . Vegetarians (especially vegans) The bioavailability of zinc from vegetarian diets is lower than from nonvegetarian diets because vegetarians typically eat large amounts of legumes and whole grains, which contain phytates that bind zinc and inhibit its absorption . In addition, meat is high in bioavailable zinc . As a result, vegetarians and vegans usually have lower dietary intakes of zinc and lower serum zinc levels than nonvegetarians . Vegetarians and vegans might benefit from using certain food preparation techniques that reduce the binding of zinc by phytates and increase its bioavailability, such as soaking beans, grains, and seeds in water for several hours before cooking them . In addition, organic acids in fermented foods might increase zinc absorption . Vegetarians and vegans might also benefit from zinc supplements . Women who are pregnant or lactating During pregnancy, the amount of zinc needed increases to accommodate fetal growth, and the FNB therefore recommends that pregnant women consume 3 mg/day more zinc than nonpregnant women in the same age group . Similarly, the zinc requirement increases by 4 mg/day during lactation. NHANES data from 2001 to 2014 show that 11% of pregnant women in the United States have total zinc intakes from foods and supplements that are below the EAR . Low serum zinc concentrations during pregnancy might increase the risk of preeclampsia and low-birthweight infants . Routine zinc supplementation during pregnancy does not appear to reduce the risk of low birthweight, stillbirth, or neonatal death, but it might lower the risk of preterm birth . During lactation, some but not all studies show that adequate intakes of foods rich in zinc increase concentrations of the mineral in breast milk. Evidence is also conflicting on whether zinc supplementation during lactation increases the zinc content of breast milk . Older infants who are exclusively breastfed Zinc concentrations in breast milk peak during the first month after birth and then decline by approximately 75% by the ninth month . Because of this sharp drop, human breast milk alone is not sufficient to meet the infant’s zinc requirement after age 6 months . The FNB recommends that in addition to breast milk, infants age 7–12 months consume age-appropriate foods or formula containing zinc . Children with sickle cell disease Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) have a high risk of zinc insufficiency or deficiency, possibly as a result of the chelation therapy used to treat iron overload . Children with SCD and low zinc status often are shorter and weigh less than age-matched peers, and they also have a higher risk of maturation delays, vaso-occlusive pain crises (blockages of blood flow to an area of the body), and associated hospitalizations . Supplemental zinc might enhance growth in children with SCD and decrease the risk of bacterial infections, hospitalizations, and vaso-occlusive pain crises . People with alcohol use disorder Low zinc status has been observed in 30% to 50% of people with alcohol use disorder . Ethanol consumption decreases intestinal absorption of zinc and increases urinary zinc excretion . In addition, the variety and amount of food consumed by many people with alcohol use disorder is limited, leading to inadequate zinc intake . Zinc and Health This section focuses on the following diseases and disorders in which zinc might play a role: the common cold, pneumonia in children, HIV in children and adults, acute childhood diarrhea (which often results from infections), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and type 2 diabetes (T2D). For information on zinc and COVID-19, see Dietary Supplements in the Time of COVID-19. The common cold Researchers have hypothesized that zinc could reduce the severity and duration of cold signs and symptoms by directly inhibiting rhinovirus binding and replication in the nasal mucosa and suppressing inflammation . In studies examining the effects of zinc supplements on the common cold, zinc is usually administered in a lozenge or syrup that temporarily sticks to the mouth and throat, placing the zinc in contact with the rhinovirus in those areas. The results from clinical trials that have examined the effects of zinc supplements on the common cold have been inconsistent. Overall, however, supplemental zinc in lozenge or syrup form appears to reduce the duration, but not the severity, of signs and symptoms of the common cold when taken shortly after a person develops a cold [57-60]. In one clinical trial, 50 adults took a zinc acetate lozenge (13.3 mg zinc) or placebo every 2–3 wakeful hours within 24 hours of developing the common cold for as long as they had cold symptoms. In comparison with placebo, the zinc lozenges reduced the duration of colds by 3 days and the severity of cold symptoms (cough, nasal discharge, and muscle aches) . In another clinical trial, 273 adults with experimentally induced colds were randomly assigned to take zinc gluconate (13.3 mg zinc) or zinc acetate (5.0 mg or 11.5 mg) lozenges every 2 to 3 hours while awake, for a total of six lozenges per day, or placebo, for up to 14 days . Duration of illness was 1 day less with the zinc gluconate supplements than with the placebo, but the lozenges had no effect on symptom severity. Furthermore, the 5.0 and 11.5 mg zinc acetate lozenges had no effect on either cold duration or severity. In a second trial described in the same report, neither zinc gluconate nor zinc acetate lozenges affected the duration or severity of cold symptoms in comparison with placebo in 281 adults with colds . A 2021 systematic review and meta-analysis included 28 randomized controlled trials (including the three described above) with a total of 5,446 participants (mostly adults younger than 65 years) who had a community-acquired viral respiratory tract infection or were inoculated with a rhinovirus . Most trials provided zinc in the form of zinc acetate or gluconate lozenges at total daily doses of 45 mg to 300 mg for up to 2 weeks, but some trials used nasal sprays or gels. In participants who used products containing zinc, symptoms resolved an average of 2 days earlier than in those who received a placebo. However, average daily symptom severity did not differ between those who were and were not treated with zinc. The author of an earlier systematic review concluded that the use of zinc lozenges at doses of over 75 mg/day reduced the duration of the common cold, whereas lower doses did not . Additional research is needed to determine the optimal dosage, formulation, and administration schedule before a general recommendation can be made regarding the use of lozenges, gels, and sprays containing zinc to reduce the severity and duration of symptoms of the common cold [58-60]. Pneumonia in children In low-income countries, pneumonia is responsible for 15% of all deaths in children younger than 5 years and for 19% of all childhood deaths . Poor zinc status is associated with greater susceptibility to pneumonia, more severe disease, and higher mortality risk in children [64-67]. Several clinical trials have examined the effects of zinc supplementation on the incidence of pneumonia and as an adjunctive treatment for pneumonia. A 2016 Cochrane Review of six trials in low-income countries found that supplementation with 10–20 mg zinc for up to 20 months in a total of 5,193 children age 2 to 59 months resulted in lower incidence and prevalence of pneumonia than placebo . However, most research suggests that the adjunctive use of zinc supplements to treat pneumonia in children does not affect mortality or time to recovery. A 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis included 11 clinical trials in children age 2 to 60 months with mostly severe pneumonia in low- and middle-income countries . Mortality rates from pneumonia and time to recovery from severe pneumonia did not differ between children treated with 10–20 mg/day supplemental zinc and those treated with placebo for 7–14 days or until discharge. Another meta-analysis of six placebo-controlled trials that included 2,216 children age 2 to 60 months found that zinc supplementation reduced mortality rates from severe pneumonia but not rates of treatment failure or of changes in antibiotic therapy . HIV in children and adults HIV infection reduces the absorption and metabolism of zinc from foods . In addition, people with HIV often have diarrhea, which can result in excessive losses of zinc. For these reasons, people with HIV often have low plasma or serum zinc levels. Several clinical trials have found some beneficial effects of zinc supplementation to manage the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection. One trial, for example, randomly assigned 231 adults who had HIV and plasma zinc levels lower than 75 mcg/dL to supplemental zinc (12 mg/day for women or 15 mg/day for men) or placebo for 18 months . The supplements reduced rates of immunological failure events (CD4+ T-cell counts less than 200 cells/mL) by 76% and rates of diarrhea by 60% but had no effect on mortality. In another trial in Iran that randomized 146 adults with HIV to 50 mg/day zinc, 200 mcg/day selenium, or placebo for 6 months and then followed participants for another 3 months, the zinc supplements decreased rates of opportunistic infections but did not improve CD4+ T-cell counts . However, findings were less positive in two Cochrane Reviews and another trial (not included in either Cochrane Review) that assessed the potential benefits of supplementation with micronutrients, including zinc, or placebo in various populations with HIV. The first Cochrane Review, which focused on micronutrient supplementation for children with HIV, included two trials that administered 10 mg/day zinc with or without vitamin A for up to 15 months in a total of 128 children with HIV in South Africa . One of these trials found that zinc supplementation had no beneficial effects in comparison with vitamin A, whereas the other found that the risk of watery diarrhea was 49% lower with zinc supplements than with placebo. A subsequent Cochrane Review that evaluated micronutrient supplements for adults with HIV included six placebo-controlled trials of zinc supplements (12–50 mg/day for 14 days to 18 months or 1 weekly 90 mg dose for 6 months) in a total of 826 participants . The authors concluded that although zinc supplements might improve zinc status, the supplements appeared to have little if any effect on CD4+ T-cell counts or viral load and inconclusive effects on mortality and diarrhea frequency. In a trial in 400 pregnant women with HIV in Tanzania, 25 mg/day zinc until 6 weeks after delivery did not result in any differences in birth weight, duration of gestation, or rates of fetal mortality or early mother-to-child transmission of HIV in comparison with placebo . In addition, zinc supplementation did not affect maternal viral load or CD4+, CD8+, or CD3+ T-cell counts. However, the supplements blunted the rise in hemoglobin concentrations between baseline and 6 weeks postpartum. More evidence is required to determine whether zinc supplements might be helpful for people with HIV. Childhood acute diarrhea Acute diarrhea is associated with high mortality rates among children in low-income countries, where it causes about 525,000 deaths annually . Zinc is used to treat acute diarrhea in children, especially in low-income countries where zinc deficiency is common. Scientists believe that zinc’s beneficial effects stem from its role in supporting adaptive immunity and maintaining the mucosal integrity of the gastrointestinal system . Clinical trials show that zinc supplementation helps shorten the duration of diarrhea in children in low-income countries. A 2016 Cochrane Review included 33 trials that compared the effects of zinc supplementation with placebo in 10,841 children age 1 month to 5 years with acute or persistent diarrhea . Most studies were conducted in Asian countries with high rates of zinc deficiency. The investigators administered zinc in the form of zinc acetate, zinc gluconate, or zinc sulfate. The most common dose was 20 mg/day, and about half the studies administered zinc for 2 weeks. The authors concluded, on the basis of evidence of low to moderate certainty, that zinc supplementation shortens the duration of diarrhea by about half a day in children older than 6 months and reduces the likelihood that diarrhea will persist for at least 7 days by 27%. In children younger than 6 months, however, zinc supplementation did not affect mean duration of diarrhea or persistence of diarrhea for 7 days. In addition, evidence that the authors deemed to have high certainty showed that zinc supplementation reduces the duration of diarrhea in children with signs of malnutrition by about a day. A 2018 systematic review and meta-analysis had similar findings. It examined the use of zinc alone or in combination with other treatments for acute diarrhea and gastroenteritis in 174 studies in 32,430 children, mostly from low- and middle-income countries . The authors concluded that zinc was one of the most effective interventions of those examined, especially when it was combined with Saccharomyces boulardii (a probiotic) or smectite (a natural clay that contains minerals), for reducing the duration of acute diarrhea and gastroenteritis in children. Analyses showed that zinc alone or in combination reduced the duration of diarrhea by about ¾ to 1½ days. The World Health Organization and UNICEF recommend short-term zinc supplementation—20 mg zinc per day, or 10 mg for infants under 6 months, for 10 to 14 days—to treat acute childhood diarrhea . Most trials of zinc supplementation for diarrhea have been conducted in low-income countries . Zinc supplements might have only a marginal effect on diarrhea duration in well-nourished children. Age-related macular degeneration AMD is the leading cause of significant vision loss in older people . The human retina has a high zinc concentration, and research has shown that supplements containing both zinc and antioxidants might delay the progression of AMD and vision loss, possibly by preventing cellular damage in the retina . Observational evidence suggests a link between higher zinc intakes and a lower risk of AMD. In a population-based cohort study in the Netherlands that included 4,170 adults age 55 or older, dietary zinc intake was inversely associated with the risk of AMD over a mean follow-up period of 8 years . Similarly, a study of 2,464 adults age 49 or older in Australia found that at 5-year and 10-year follow-up, participants with intakes of zinc from food and supplements in the top decile (at least 15.8 mg/day) had a 44% lower risk of any AMD and a 46% lower risk of early AMD than participants in all other deciles . Clinical trial evidence has confirmed the benefits of zinc supplementation, in combination with certain antioxidants, for slowing the progression of AMD. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) was a clinical trial in 4,757 participants age 50 to 80 years with a high risk of advanced AMD (i.e., they had intermediate AMD or advanced AMD in one eye and good vision in the other eye) . AREDS found that participants who took a supplement each day containing 80 mg zinc in the form of zinc oxide, 15 mg (7,500 mcg retinol activity equivalent [RAE]) beta-carotene, 180 mg (400 International Units [IU]) vitamin E in the form of dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate, 500 mg vitamin C, and 2 mg copper for 5 years had a 25% lower risk of advanced AMD than those taking a placebo. The follow-up AREDS2 study confirmed the value of the AREDS supplement in reducing the progression of AMD in 4,203 participants over a median follow-up period of 5 years . AREDS2 also showed that a formulation providing 25 mg zinc (about one-third the amount in the original formulation) provided the same protective effect against advanced AMD. However, because AREDS2 had fewer participants than the original AREDS study, and fewer than half took the formula containing less zinc, the researchers viewed this finding as preliminary. The National Eye Institute recommends use of an AREDS formulation providing 80 mg zinc . Individuals who have or are developing AMD should talk to their health care provider about their zinc intakes and the supplement formulations used in the AREDS studies. Type 2 diabetes Zinc concentrations are often low in people with T2D . Researchers therefore hypothesize that zinc depletion might play a role in diabetes progression. Several observational studies have found an association between zinc intakes and risk of T2D. In a systematic review and meta-analysis that included 16 observational studies conducted in the United States, Australia, Sweden, India, and Japan with a total of 146,027 men and women age 18 to 84 years, the risk of T2D was 13% lower in participants with the highest zinc intakes than in those with the lowest intakes . When the researchers analyzed the influence of area of residence on the results, the associations between zinc intakes and T2D risk were significant only for studies conducted in rural areas and not those conducted in urban areas. Clinical trials have assessed the utility of zinc supplements to reduce the risk of T2D or to manage its complications. In a 2015 Cochrane Review of the clinical trial evidence on zinc supplementation for T2D prevention, only three trials with a total of 128 participants met the inclusion criteria . These studies administered 30 mg to 100 mg zinc (in the form of zinc sulfate or zinc amino chelate) per day for 4 to 12 weeks, but the quality of these studies could not be assessed because of the lack of relevant information in the study reports. The Cochrane Review authors concluded that evidence is lacking on which to base conclusions about the use of zinc supplementation to prevent T2D. However, studies published since the Cochrane Review have had more positive findings. A systematic review and meta-analysis included nine placebo-controlled trials assessing the effects of zinc supplementation (7 mg/day to 150 mg/day) for 6 to 52 weeks on lipid profiles in a total of 424 people with T2D . The supplements had beneficial effects on serum levels of triglycerides and total cholesterol but not on serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. A second systematic review and meta-analysis compared the effects of low-dose zinc supplements (less than 25 mg/day) with those of high-dose supplements (25 to 75 mg/day) on risk factors for T2D and cardiovascular disease in 27 clinical trials (including two from the 2015 Cochrane Review) . Zinc supplements were administered for 4 weeks to 12 months (mean 11 weeks) to a total of 1,042 participants age 6 to 106 years (but most studies included adults age 20 to 70 years) and placebo to 974 participants. Although low-dose and high-dose zinc supplements had beneficial effects on several outcomes assessed, low doses of zinc and longer administration improved a larger number of risk factors. For example, studies that administered zinc supplements for less than 12 weeks had beneficial effects on fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance, and triglyceride levels, whereas studies that administered the supplements for longer had positive effects on fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c, triglyceride, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol levels. Sensitivity analyses showed no significant effect of zinc dosage on these outcomes. A third systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the effects of zinc supplements on T2D prevention and management in 32 trials that administered zinc supplements (4 to 240 mg/day zinc, mean 35 mg/day) or placebo for 1 to 12 months to a total of 1,700 adults age 18 and older with T2D (except that one included study was in children age 6 to 10 years) . The supplements reduced fasting glucose, 2-hour postprandial glucose, fasting insulin, insulin resistance, glycated hemoglobin, and C-reactive protein levels. Glycemic indicators did not vary by zinc dosage (less than 30 mg/day or at least 30 mg/day) or duration of supplementation (1 month or more than 1 month). Research has also explored the potential benefits of zinc supplementation in people with gestational diabetes. A systematic review and meta-analysis of five placebo-controlled trials that included 263 people with gestational diabetes evaluated the effects of zinc supplementation (4 to 30 mg/day zinc with or without vitamin E, magnesium, calcium, vitamin D, or a combination) on metabolic status . The supplements had beneficial effects on fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and insulin resistance, but did not affect LDL or total cholesterol levels. However, because this analysis included studies that administered zinc in combination with other nutrients, the potential contribution of zinc by itself cannot be assessed. Up to one quarter of people with T2D develop diabetic foot ulcers, which can result in amputation . A Cochrane Review of nutritional interventions to treat diabetic foot ulcers included one trial in 60 participants of 50 mg zinc (in the form of zinc sulfate) or placebo for 12 weeks . The authors concluded that whether zinc supplements affect diabetic foot ulcers over time is uncertain. Overall, the evidence to date is insufficient to support any conclusions about the impact of zinc supplementation on the prevalence or severity of T2D, gestational diabetes, or diabetic foot ulcers. Health Risks from Excessive Zinc High zinc intakes can cause nausea, dizziness, headaches, gastric distress, vomiting, and loss of appetite . If used for weeks, doses of 50 mg zinc or more—typically from supplements or excessive use of denture adhesive creams that contain zinc—can interfere with copper absorption (which can cause low copper status), reduce immune function, and lower HDL cholesterol levels [1-3,97]. The amount of zinc obtained from food is rarely as high as 50 mg, so the zinc in foods is unlikely to cause zinc toxicity. Very high doses of zinc from supplements (142 mg/day) might also interfere with magnesium absorption and disrupt magnesium balance . According to a few reports, overuse of denture adhesive creams containing up to 34 mg zinc per gram of product can lead to neurological symptoms (including sensory ataxia and myelopathy) and anemia. Zinc-free formulations are available to prevent these effects . The FNB has established ULs for zinc from food and supplements for healthy individuals on the basis of levels that have an adverse effect on copper status (Table 3) . The ULs do not apply to individuals receiving zinc for medical treatment, but such individuals should be under the care of a physician. Table 3: Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for Zinc Birth to 6 months: Male: 4 mg, Female: 4 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  7–12 months: Male: 5 mg, Female: 5 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  1–3 years: Male: 7 mg, Female: 7 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  4–8 years: Male: 12 mg, Female: 12 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  9–13 years: Male: 23 mg, Female: 23 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  14–18 years: Male: 34 mg, Female: 34 mg, Pregnancy: 34 mg, Lactation: 34 mg 19+ years: Male: 40 mg, Female: 40 mg, Pregnancy: 40 mg, Lactation: 40 mg Interactions with Medications Zinc has the potential to interact with certain medications. In addition, several types of medications might adversely affect zinc levels. A few examples are provided below. Individuals taking these and other medications on a regular basis should discuss their zinc status with their health care providers. Antibiotics Both quinolone antibiotics (such as Cipro) and tetracycline antibiotics (such as Achromycin and Sumycin) might interact with zinc in the gastrointestinal tract, which could inhibit the absorption of both zinc and the antibiotic if they are taken at the same time . Taking the antibiotic at least 2 hours before or 4–6 hours after the zinc supplement minimizes this interaction . Penicillamine Zinc can reduce the absorption and action of penicillamine, a drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and Wilson disease . To minimize this interaction, people should take zinc supplements and penicillamine at least 1 hour apart. Diuretics Thiazide diuretics, such as chlorthalidone (Hygroton and Thalitone) and hydrochlorothiazide (e.g., Esidrix and HydroDIURIL), increase zinc excretion in the urine. This increased excretion, in turn, decreases serum zinc concentrations . Zinc and Healthful Diets The federal government’s 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\" For more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA’s MyPlate. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy eating pattern as one that Includes a variety of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fat-free or low-fat milk and milk products, and oils. Some dairy products are good sources of zinc. Some ready-to-eat breakfast cereals are fortified with zinc. Includes a variety of protein foods, including seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs, legumes (beans and peas), nuts, seeds, and soy products. Some meats contain high amounts of zinc.

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet. Introduction Iron is a mineral that is naturally present in many foods, added to some food products, and available as a dietary supplement. Iron is an essential component of hemoglobin, an erythrocyte (red blood cell) protein that transfers oxygen from the lungs to the tissues . As a component of myoglobin, another protein that provides oxygen, iron supports muscle metabolism and healthy connective tissue . Iron is also necessary for physical growth, neurological development, cellular functioning, and synthesis of some hormones . Dietary iron has two main forms: heme and nonheme . Plants and iron-fortified foods contain nonheme iron only, whereas meat, seafood, and poultry contain both heme and nonheme iron . Heme iron, which is formed when iron combines with protoporphyrin IX, contributes about 10% to 15% of total iron intakes in western populations [3-5]. Most of the 3 to 4 grams of elemental iron in adults is in hemoglobin . Much of the remaining iron is stored in the form of ferritin or hemosiderin (a degradation product of ferritin) in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow or is located in myoglobin in muscle tissue . Transferrin is the main protein in blood that binds to iron and transports it throughout the body. Humans typically lose only small amounts of iron in urine, feces, the gastrointestinal tract, and skin. Losses are greater in menstruating women because of blood loss. Hepcidin, a circulating peptide hormone, is the key regulator of both iron absorption and the distribution of iron throughout the body, including in plasma . The assessment of iron status depends almost entirely on hematological indicators . However, these indicators are not sensitive or specific enough to adequately describe the full spectrum of iron status, and this can complicate the diagnosis of iron deficiency. A complementary approach is to consider how iron intakes from the diet and dietary supplements compare with recommended intakes. Iron deficiency progresses from depletion of iron stores (mild iron deficiency), to iron-deficiency erythropoiesis (erythrocyte production), and finally to iron deficiency anemia (IDA) . With iron-deficiency erythropoiesis (also known as marginal iron deficiency), iron stores are depleted and transferrin saturation declines, but hemoglobin levels are usually within the normal range. IDA is characterized by low hemoglobin concentrations, and decreases in hematocrit (the proportion of red blood cells in blood by volume) and mean corpuscular volume (a measure of erythrocyte size) . Serum ferritin concentration, a measure of the body's iron stores, is currently the most efficient and cost-effective test for diagnosing iron deficiency [11-13]. Because serum ferritin decreases during the first stage of iron depletion, it can identify low iron status before the onset of IDA . A serum ferritin concentration lower than 30 mcg/L suggests iron deficiency, and a value lower than 10 mcg/L suggests IDA . However, serum ferritin is subject to influence by inflammation (due, for example, to infectious disease), which elevates serum ferritin concentrations . Hemoglobin and hematocrit tests are the most commonly used measures to screen patients for iron deficiency, even though they are neither sensitive nor specific . Often, hemoglobin concentrations are combined with serum ferritin measurements to identify IDA . Hemoglobin concentrations lower than 11 g/dL in children under 10 years of age, or lower than 12 g/dL in individuals age 10 years or older, suggest IDA . Normal hematocrit values are approximately 41% to 50% in males and 36% to 44% in females . Recommended Intakes Intake recommendations for iron and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academies (formerly National Academy of Sciences) . DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and gender, include the following: Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects Table 1 lists the current iron RDAs for nonvegetarians. The RDAs for vegetarians are 1.8 times higher than for people who eat meat. This is because heme iron from meat is more bioavailable than nonheme iron from plant-based foods, and meat, poultry, and seafood increase the absorption of nonheme iron . For infants from birth to 6 months, the FNB established an AI for iron that is equivalent to the mean intake of iron in healthy, breastfed infants. Table 1: Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for Iron Birth to 6 months: Male: 0.27 mg*, Female: 0.27 mg*, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  7–12 months: Male: 11 mg, Female: 11 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  1–3 years: Male: 7 mg, Female: 7 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  4–8 years: Male: 10 mg, Female: 10 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  9–13 years: Male: 8 mg, Female: 8 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  14–18 years: Male: 11 mg, Female: 15 mg, Pregnancy: 27 mg, Lactation: 10 mg 19–50 years: Male: 8 mg, Female: 18 mg, Pregnancy: 27 mg, Lactation: 9 mg 51+ years: Male: 8 mg, Female: 8 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  * Adequate Intake (AI) Sources of Iron Food The richest sources of heme iron in the diet include lean meat and seafood . Dietary sources of nonheme iron include nuts, beans, vegetables, and fortified grain products. In the United States, about half of dietary iron comes from bread, cereal, and other grain products . Breast milk contains highly bioavailable iron but in amounts that are not sufficient to meet the needs of infants older than 4 to 6 months . In the United States, Canada, and many other countries, wheat and other flours are fortified with iron . Infant formulas are fortified with 12 mg iron per liter . Heme iron has higher bioavailability than nonheme iron, and other dietary components have less effect on the bioavailability of heme than nonheme iron . The bioavailability of iron is approximately 14% to 18% from mixed diets that include substantial amounts of meat, seafood, and vitamin C (ascorbic acid, which enhances the bioavailability of nonheme iron) and 5% to 12% from vegetarian diets . In addition to ascorbic acid, meat, poultry, and seafood can enhance nonheme iron absorption, whereas phytate (present in grains and beans) and certain polyphenols in some nonanimal foods (such as cereals and legumes) have the opposite effect . Unlike other inhibitors of iron absorption, calcium might reduce the bioavailability of both nonheme and heme iron. However, the effects of enhancers and inhibitors of iron absorption are attenuated by a typical mixed western diet, so they have little effect on most people’s iron status. Several food sources of iron are listed in Table 2. Some plant-based foods that are good sources of iron, such as spinach, have low iron bioavailability because they contain iron-absorption inhibitors, such as polyphenols .

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for iron is 18 mg for adults and children age 4 years and older . FDA requires food labels to list iron content. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) FoodData Central lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides a comprehensive list of foods containing iron arranged by nutrient content and by food name. Dietary supplements Iron is available in many dietary supplements. Multivitamin/mineral supplements with iron, especially those designed for women, typically provide 18 mg iron (100% of the DV). Multivitamin/mineral supplements for men or seniors frequently contain less or no iron. Iron-only supplements usually deliver more than the DV, with many providing 65 mg iron (360% of the DV). Frequently used forms of iron in supplements include ferrous and ferric iron salts, such as ferrous sulfate, ferrous gluconate, ferric citrate, and ferric sulfate . Because of its higher solubility, ferrous iron in dietary supplements is more bioavailable than ferric iron . High doses of supplemental iron (45 mg/day or more) may cause gastrointestinal side effects, such as nausea and constipation . Other forms of supplemental iron, such as heme iron polypeptides, carbonyl iron, iron amino-acid chelates, and polysaccharide-iron complexes, might have fewer gastrointestinal side effects than ferrous or ferric salts . The different forms of iron in supplements contain varying amounts of elemental iron. For example, ferrous fumarate is 33% elemental iron by weight, whereas ferrous sulfate is 20% and ferrous gluconate is 12% elemental iron . Fortunately, elemental iron is listed in the Supplement Facts panel, so consumers do not need to calculate the amount of iron supplied by various forms of iron supplements. Approximately 14% to 18% of Americans use a supplement containing iron . Rates of use of supplements containing iron vary by age and gender, ranging from 6% of children age 12 to 19 years to 60% of women who are lactating and 72% of pregnant women . Calcium might interfere with the absorption of iron, although this effect has not been definitively established . For this reason, some experts suggest that people take individual calcium and iron supplements at different times of the day . Iron Intakes and Status People in the United States usually obtain adequate amounts of iron from their diets, but infants, young children, teenage girls, pregnant women, and premenopausal women are at risk of obtaining insufficient amounts [28,33-35]. The average daily iron intake from foods is 11.5–13.7 mg/day in children age 2–11 years, 15.1 mg/day in children and teens age 12–19 years, and 16.3–18.2 mg/day in men and 12.6–13.5 mg/day in women older than 19 . The average daily iron intake from foods and supplements is 13.7–15.1 mg/day in children age 2–11 years, 16.3 mg/day in children and teens age 12–19 years, and 19.3–20.5 mg/day in men and 17.0–18.9 mg/day in women older than 19. The median dietary iron intake in pregnant women is 14.7 mg/day . Rates of iron deficiency vary by race and other sociodemographic factors. Six percent of White and Black toddlers age 1 to 3 years in the United States are iron deficient (defined as at least two abnormal results for the child’s age and gender on transferrin saturation, free erythrocyte protoporphyrin, and/or serum ferritin tests), compared with 12% of Hispanic toddlers . Deficiency (including IDA) is more common among children and adolescents in food-insecure households than in food-secure households . Among pregnant women, deficiency based on depleted iron stores is more common in Mexican American (23.6%) and non-Hispanic Black women (29.6%) than in non-Hispanic White women (13.9%) . Some groups are at risk of obtaining excess iron. Individuals with hereditary hemochromatosis, which predisposes them to absorb excessive amounts of dietary iron, have an increased risk of iron overload . One study suggests that elderly people are more likely to have chronic positive iron balance and elevated total body iron than iron deficiency. Among 1,106 elderly White adults age 67 to 96 years in the Framingham Heart Study, 13% had high iron stores (serum ferritin levels higher than 300 mcg/L in men and 200 mcg/L in women), of which only 1% was due to chronic disease . The authors did not assess genotypes, so they could not determine whether these results were due to hemochromatosis . Iron Deficiency Iron deficiency is not uncommon in the United States, especially among young children, women of reproductive age, and pregnant women. Because iron deficiency is associated with poor diet, malabsorptive disorders, and blood loss, people with iron deficiency usually have other nutrient deficiencies . The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that approximately half of the 1.62 billion cases of anemia worldwide are due to iron deficiency . In developing countries, iron deficiency often results from enteropathies and blood loss associated with gastrointestinal parasites . Iron depletion and deficiency progresses through several stages [8-10]: Mild deficiency or storage iron depletion: Serum ferritin concentrations and levels of iron in bone marrow decrease. Marginal deficiency, mild functional deficiency, or iron-deficient erythropoiesis (erythrocyte production): Iron stores are depleted, iron supply to erythropoietic cells and transferrin saturation decline, but hemoglobin levels are usually within the normal range. IDA: Iron stores are exhausted; hematocrit and levels of hemoglobin decline; and the resulting microcytic, hypochromic anemia is characterized by small red blood cells with low hemoglobin concentrations. Mild deficiency or storage iron depletion: Serum ferritin concentrations and levels of iron in bone marrow decrease. Marginal deficiency, mild functional deficiency, or iron-deficient erythropoiesis (erythrocyte production): Iron stores are depleted, iron supply to erythropoietic cells and transferrin saturation decline, but hemoglobin levels are usually within the normal range. IDA: Iron stores are exhausted; hematocrit and levels of hemoglobin decline; and the resulting microcytic, hypochromic anemia is characterized by small red blood cells with low hemoglobin concentrations. In 2002, the WHO characterized IDA as one of the 10 leading risk factors for disease around the world . Although iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia, deficiencies of other micronutrients (such as folate and vitamin B12) and other factors (such as chronic infection and inflammation) can cause different forms of anemia or contribute to their severity. The functional deficits associated with IDA include gastrointestinal disturbances; weakness; fatigue; difficulty concentrating; and impaired cognitive function, immune function, exercise or work performance, and body temperature regulation . In infants and children, IDA can result in psychomotor and cognitive abnormalities that, without treatment, can lead to learning difficulties . Some evidence indicates that the effects of deficiencies early in life persist through adulthood . Because iron deficiency is often accompanied by deficiencies of other nutrients, the signs and symptoms of iron deficiency can be difficult to isolate . Groups at Risk of Iron Inadequacy The following groups are among those most likely to have inadequate intakes of iron. Pregnant women During pregnancy, plasma volume and red cell mass expand due to dramatic increases in maternal red blood cell production . As a result of this expansion and to meet the needs of the fetus and placenta, the amount of iron that women need increases during pregnancy. Iron deficiency during pregnancy increases the risk of maternal and infant mortality, premature birth, and low birthweight . Infants and young children Infants—especially those born preterm or with low birthweight or whose mothers have iron deficiency—are at risk of iron deficiency because of their high iron requirements due to their rapid growth . Full-term infants usually have sufficient iron stores and need little if any iron from external sources until they are 4 to 6 months old . However, full-term infants have a risk of becoming iron deficient at 6 to 9 months unless they obtain adequate amounts of solid foods that are rich in bioavailable iron or iron-fortified formula. Women with heavy menstrual bleeding Women of reproductive age who have menorrhagia, or abnormally heavy bleeding during menstruation, are at increased risk of iron deficiency. At least 10% of menstruating women are believed to have menorrhagia, but the percentage varies widely depending on the diagnostic criteria used [46-48]. Women with menorrhagia lose significantly more iron per menstrual cycle on average than women with normal menstrual bleeding . Limited evidence suggests that menorrhagia might be responsible for about 33% to 41% of cases of IDA in women of reproductive age . Frequent blood donors Frequent blood donors have an increased risk of iron deficiency . In the United States, adults may donate blood as often as every 8 weeks, which can deplete iron stores. About 25%–35% of regular blood donors develop iron deficiency . In a study of 2,425 blood donors, men who had given at least three and women who had given at least two whole-blood donations in the previous year were more than five times as likely to have depleted iron stores as first-time donors . A clinical trial of iron supplementation found that of 215 adults who had donated a unit of blood within the past 3–8 days, those randomized to take an iron supplement (37.5 mg/day elemental iron from ferrous gluconate) for 24 weeks recovered their lost hemoglobin and iron in less than half the time of those not given the supplement . Without iron supplementation, two-thirds of the donors had not recovered the iron they lost, even after 24 weeks. People with cancer Up to 60% of patients with colon cancer have iron deficiency at diagnosis, probably due to chronic blood loss . The prevalence of iron deficiency in patients with other types of cancer ranges from 29% to 46%. The main causes of iron deficiency in people with cancer are anemia of chronic disease (discussed in the Iron and Health section below) and chemotherapy-induced anemia. However, chronic blood loss and deficiencies of other nutrients (due, for example, to cancer-induced anorexia) can exacerbate iron deficiency in this population. People who have gastrointestinal disorders or have had gastrointestinal surgery People with certain gastrointestinal disorders (such as celiac disease, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn’s disease) or who have undergone certain gastrointestinal surgical procedures (such as gastrectomy or intestinal resection) have an increased risk of iron deficiency because their disorder or surgery requires dietary restrictions or results in iron malabsorption or blood loss in the gastrointestinal tract [55-57]. The combination of low iron intake and high iron loss can lead to a negative iron balance; reduced production of hemoglobin; or microcytic, hypochromic anemia . People with heart failure Approximately 60% of patients with chronic heart failure have iron deficiency and 17% have IDA, which might be associated with a higher risk of death in this population . Potential causes of iron deficiency in people with heart failure include poor nutrition; malabsorption; defective mobilization of iron stores; cardiac cachexia; and use of aspirin and oral anticoagulants, which might result in the loss of some blood in the gastrointestinal tract . Iron and Health This section focuses on the role of iron in IDA in pregnant women, infants, and toddlers as well as in anemia of chronic disease. Iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women Insufficient iron intakes during pregnancy increase a woman’s risk of IDA [62-65]. Low intakes also increase her infant’s risk of low birthweight, premature birth, low iron stores, and impaired cognitive and behavioral development. An analysis of 1999–2006 data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) found that 18% of pregnant women in the United States had iron deficiency . Rates of deficiency were 6.9% among women in the first trimester,14.3% in the second trimester, and 29.7% in the third trimester. Randomized controlled trials have shown that iron supplementation can prevent IDA in pregnant women and related adverse consequences in their infants . A Cochrane Review showed that daily supplementation with 9–90 mg iron reduced the risk of anemia in pregnant women at term by 70% and of iron deficiency at term by 57% . In the same review, use of daily iron supplements was associated with an 8.4% risk of having a low-birthweight newborn compared to 10.2% with no supplementation. In addition, mean birthweight was 31 g higher for infants whose mothers took daily iron supplements during pregnancy compared with the infants of mothers who did not take iron. Guidelines on iron supplementation during pregnancy vary: The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends low-dose iron supplementation (dose not specified) starting in the first trimester to decrease the prevalence of maternal anemia at delivery . It also recommends screening all pregnant women for anemia in the first trimester and again at 24 to 28 weeks gestation, and evaluating those who have anemia (defined as hematocrit levels less than 33% in the first and third trimesters and less than 32% in the second trimester) to determine the cause. ACOG states that IDA during pregnancy is associated with increased risks of preterm birth, low birth weight, and perinatal mortality and should be treated with iron supplementation in addition to prenatal vitamins. In contrast, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has concluded that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of both screening for iron deficiency and IDA in pregnant women and routinely supplementing them with iron to prevent adverse maternal and infant health outcomes . They note, however, that their recommendation applies to asymptomatic pregnant women. It does not apply to pregnant women who are severely malnourished, have symptoms of iron deficiency or IDA, or have conditions such as sickle cell disease or nutritional deficiencies that may increase iron needs. The IOM notes that because the median intake of dietary iron by pregnant women is well below the EAR, pregnant women need iron supplementation . The Dietary Guidelines for Americans advises that women who are pregnant take an iron supplement when recommended by an obstetrician or other health care provider . It adds that low intakes of iron are a public health concern for pregnant women. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends low-dose iron supplementation (dose not specified) starting in the first trimester to decrease the prevalence of maternal anemia at delivery . It also recommends screening all pregnant women for anemia in the first trimester and again at 24 to 28 weeks gestation, and evaluating those who have anemia (defined as hematocrit levels less than 33% in the first and third trimesters and less than 32% in the second trimester) to determine the cause.

The Dietary Guidelines for Americans advises that women who are pregnant take an iron supplement when recommended by an obstetrician or other health care provider . It adds that low intakes of iron are a public health concern for pregnant women. Iron deficiency anemia in infants and toddlers Approximately 12% of infants age 6 to 11 months in the United States have inadequate iron intakes, and 8% of toddlers have iron deficiency . The prevalence of IDA in U.S. toddlers age 12 to 35 months ranges from 0.9% to 4.4% depending on race or ethnicity and socioeconomic status . Full-term infants typically have adequate iron stores for approximately the first 4 to 6 months, but the risk of iron deficiency in low-birthweight and preterm infants begins at birth because of their low iron stores. IDA in infancy can lead to adverse cognitive and psychological effects, including delayed attention and social withdrawal; some of these effects might be irreversible . In addition, IDA is associated with higher lead concentrations in the blood (although the cause of this is not fully understood), which can increase the risk of neurotoxicity . A Cochrane Review of 26 studies in 2,726 preterm and low-birthweight infants found that enteral iron supplementation (at least 1 mg/kg/day) reduces the risk of iron deficiency, but the long-term effects of supplementation on neurodevelopmental outcomes and growth is not clear . Another Cochrane Review of eight trials in 3,748 children younger than 2 in low-income countries showed that home fortification of semi-solid foods with micronutrient powders containing 12.5 mg to 30 mg elemental iron as ferrous fumarate and 4 to 14 other micronutrients for 2 to 12 months reduced rates of anemia by 31% and of iron deficiency by 51% compared with no intervention or placebo but had no effect on any growth measurements . Guidelines vary on dietary iron intakes and possible supplementation to ensure adequate iron status and to prevent or treat IDA in infants and young children: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that infants less than 12 months of age who are not exclusively or primarily breastfed drink iron-fortified infant formula . Breastfed infants who were born preterm or with a low birthweight should receive 2–4 mg/kg/day of iron drops (to a maximum of 15 mg/day) from ages 1–12 months. Breastfed infants who receive insufficient iron (less than 1 mg/kg/day) from supplementary foods by age 6 months should receive 1 mg/kg/day of iron drops. The CDC also recommends that infants and preschool children at high risk for IDA (e.g., children from low-income families and migrant children) be screened between age 9–12 months, 6 months later, and annually from age 2–5 years. Treatment for IDA begins with 3 mg/kg/day of iron drops given between meals. (See reference 17 for additional advice from the CDC.) The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends 1 mg/kg daily iron supplementation for exclusively or primarily breastfed full-term infants from age 4 months until the infants begin eating iron-containing complementary foods, such as iron-fortified cereals . Standard infant formulas containing 10 to 12 mg/L iron can meet the iron needs of infants for the first year of life. The Academy recommends 2 mg/kg/day iron supplementation for preterm infants age 1 to 12 months who are fed breast milk. The WHO recommends universal supplementation with 2 mg/kg/day of iron in children age 6 to 23 months whose diet does not include foods fortified with iron or who live in regions (such as developing countries) where anemia prevalence is higher than 40% . In a recommendation statement issued in 2015, the USPSTF concluded that the available evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against routine screening for IDA in children age 6 to 24 months who live in the United States and who are asymptomatic for IDA . It added that this recommendation does not apply to severely malnourished children or children who were born prematurely or with low birthweight. Earlier, in 2006, the USPSTF stated that although it found insufficient evidence to recommend routine iron supplementation in asymptomatic infants at average risk of IDA, it did recommend routine iron supplements for children age 6 to 12 months who are at increased risk of IDA (e.g., those who were premature or low birthweight) . The USPSTF's 2015 statement notes that its current recommendation is limited to screening because the widespread use of iron-fortified foods in the United States (including infant formulas and cereals) would likely limit the impact of iron supplementation prescribed by physicians . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that infants less than 12 months of age who are not exclusively or primarily breastfed drink iron-fortified infant formula . Breastfed infants who were born preterm or with a low birthweight should receive 2–4 mg/kg/day of iron drops (to a maximum of 15 mg/day) from ages 1–12 months. Breastfed infants who receive insufficient iron (less than 1 mg/kg/day) from supplementary foods by age 6 months should receive 1 mg/kg/day of iron drops.

The USPSTF's 2015 statement notes that its current recommendation is limited to screening because the widespread use of iron-fortified foods in the United States (including infant formulas and cereals) would likely limit the impact of iron supplementation prescribed by physicians . Some studies have suggested that iron supplementation in young children living in areas where malaria is endemic could increase their risk of malaria . However, a Cochrane Review of 33 trials in 13,114 children showed that intermittent supplementation does not appear to have this effect . The WHO therefore recommends 6-month supplementation cycles as follows: children age 24 to 59 months should receive 25 mg iron and those age 5 to 12 years should receive 45 mg every week for 3 months, followed by 3 months of no supplementation . The WHO recommends providing these supplements in malaria-endemic areas in conjunction with measures to prevent, diagnose, and treat malaria. Anemia of chronic disease Certain inflammatory, infectious, and neoplastic diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and hematologic malignancies) can cause anemia of chronic disease, also known as anemia of inflammation . Anemia of chronic disease is the second most common type of anemia after IDA . In people with anemia of chronic disease, inflammatory cytokines upregulate the hormone hepcidin. As a result, iron homeostasis is disrupted and iron is diverted from the circulation to storage sites, limiting the amount of iron available for erythropoiesis. Anemia of chronic disease is usually mild to moderate (hemoglobin levels 8 to 9.5 g/dL) and is associated with low counts of erythrocytes and decreased erythropoiesis . The condition can be difficult to diagnose because, although low serum ferritin levels indicate iron deficiency, these levels tend to be higher in patients with infection or inflammation . The clinical implications of iron deficiency in people with chronic diseases are not clear. Even mild anemia of chronic disease is associated with an increased risk of hospitalization and mortality in elderly people . Two prospective observational studies found that iron deficiency in patients with objectively measured heart failure was associated with an increased risk of heart transplantation and death, and this association was independent of other well-established prognostic factors for poor outcomes, including anemia . However, an analysis of NHANES data on 574 adults with self-reported heart failure found no association between iron deficiency and all-cause or cardiovascular mortality . The main therapy for anemia of chronic disease is treatment of the underlying disease . But when such treatment is not possible, iron supplementation and/or erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are sometimes used. The use of iron supplements—whether oral, intravenous, or parenteral—in this setting is controversial because they might increase the risk of infection and cardiovascular events and could cause tissue damage . Only a few small studies have evaluated the benefits of oral iron supplementation alone or in combination with ESAs to treat anemia of chronic disease. For example, a prospective observational study in 132 patients with anemia and chronic kidney disease who were not on dialysis or ESAs found that oral supplements (130 mg/day elemental iron from ferrous sulfate twice daily) for 1 year resulted in a decline in hemoglobin of only 0.13 g/dL compared with 0.46 g/dL in the placebo group . A randomized trial of oral iron supplements (equivalent to 200 mg/day elemental iron, form of iron not specified) taken with an ESA once weekly in 100 patients with cancer-related anemia resulted in a mean increase of 2.4 g/dL hemoglobin after 24 weeks compared with oral supplements only . Iron administered parentally increases hemoglobin levels to a greater extent and is associated with fewer side effects than oral iron supplementation in patients with anemia of chronic disease . Health Risks from Excessive Iron Adults with normal intestinal function have very little risk of iron overload from dietary sources of iron . However, supplements containing 25 mg iron or more can reduce zinc absorption and plasma zinc concentrations . High-dose iron supplements can also cause gastrointestinal effects, including gastric upset, constipation, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea . Taking iron supplements with food can help minimize these adverse effects. Case reports, some involving doses of 130 mg iron, suggest that some people develop even more serious gastrointestinal effects, including gastritis and gastric lesions (along with iron deposits in the gastric mucosa in some cases) [90-93]. Acute intakes of more than 20 mg/kg iron (about 1,365 mg iron for a person weighing 150 lb) from supplements or medicines can lead to corrosive necrosis of the intestine, which might lead to fluid and blood loss, shock, tissue damage, and organ failure, especially if food is not taken at the same time as the iron . In severe cases (e.g., one-time ingestions of 60 mg/kg, or about 4,090 mg iron for a 150-lb person), overdoses of iron can lead to multisystem organ failure, coma, convulsions, and even death . Between 1983 and 2000, at least 43 U.S. children died from ingesting supplements containing high doses of iron (36–443 mg iron/kg body weight) . Accidental ingestion of iron supplements caused about a third of poisoning deaths among children reported in the United States between 1983 and 1991. In 1997, FDA began requiring oral supplements containing more than 30 mg elemental iron per dose to be sold in single-dose packaging with strong warning labels. At the same time, many manufacturers voluntarily replaced the sugar coating on iron tablets with film coatings. Between 1998 and 2002, only one child death due to ingesting an iron-containing tablet was reported . As a result of a court decision, FDA removed its single-dose packaging requirement for iron supplements in 2003 . FDA currently requires that iron-containing dietary supplements sold in solid form (e.g., tablets or capsules but not powders) carry the following label statement: “WARNING: Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6. Keep this product out of reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, call a doctor or poison control center immediately” . In addition, since 1978, the Consumer Product Safety Commission has required manufacturers to package dietary supplements containing 250 mg or more elemental iron per container in child-resistant bottles or packaging to prevent accidental poisoning . Hemochromatosis, a disease caused by a mutation in the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene, is associated with an excessive buildup of iron in the body . About 1 in 10 Whites carry the most common HFE mutation (C282Y), but only 4.4 Whites per 1,000 are homozygous for the mutation and have hemochromatosis . The condition is much less common in other ethnic groups. Without treatment by periodic chelation or phlebotomy, people with hereditary hemochromatosis typically develop signs of iron toxicity by their 30s . These effects can include liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, heart disease, and impaired pancreatic function. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recommends that treatment of hemochromatosis include the avoidance of iron and vitamin C supplements . The FNB has established ULs for iron from food and supplements based on the amounts of iron that are associated with gastrointestinal effects following supplemental intakes of iron salts (see Table 3). The ULs apply to healthy infants, children, and adults. Physicians sometimes prescribe intakes higher than the UL, such as when people with IDA need higher doses to replenish their iron stores . Table 3: Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for Iron Birth to 6 months: Male: 40 mg, Female: 40 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  7–12 months: Male: 40 mg, Female: 40 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  1–3 years: Male: 40 mg, Female: 40 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  4–8 years: Male: 40 mg, Female: 40 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  9–13 years: Male: 40 mg, Female: 40 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  14–18 years: Male: 45 mg, Female: 45 mg, Pregnancy: 45 mg, Lactation: 45 mg 19+ years: Male: 45 mg, Female: 45 mg, Pregnancy: 45 mg, Lactation: 45 mg Interactions with Medications Iron can interact with certain medications, and some medications can have an adverse effect on iron levels. A few examples are provided below. Individuals taking these and other medications on a regular basis should discuss their iron status with their health care providers. Levodopa Some evidence indicates that in healthy people, iron supplements reduce the absorption of levodopa (found in Sinemet and Stalevo), used to treat Parkinson’s disease and restless leg syndrome, possibly through chelation [101-103]. In the United States, the labels for levodopa warn that iron-containing dietary supplements might reduce the amount of levodopa available to the body and, thus, diminish its clinical effectiveness . Levothyroxine Levothyroxine (Levothroid, Levoxyl, Synthroid, Tirosint, and Unithroid) is used to treat hypothyroidism, goiter, and thyroid cancer. The simultaneous ingestion of iron and levothyroxine can result in clinically significant reductions in levothyroxine efficacy in some patients . The labels for some of these products warn that iron supplements can reduce the absorption of levothyroxine tablets and advise against administering levothyroxine within 4 hours of iron supplements. Proton pump inhibitors Gastric acid plays an important role in the absorption of nonheme iron from the diet. Because proton pump inhibitors, such as lansoprazole (Prevacid) and omeprazole (Prilosec), reduce the acidity of stomach contents, they can reduce iron absorption . Treatment with proton pump inhibitors for up to 10 years is not associated with iron depletion or anemia in people with normal iron stores but patients with iron deficiency taking proton pump inhibitors can have suboptimal responses to iron supplementation . Iron and Healthful Diets The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\" For more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that Includes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils. Many ready-to-eat breakfast cereals are fortified with iron, and some fruits and vegetables contain iron. Includes a variety of protein foods such as lean meats; poultry; eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; nuts and seeds; and soy products. Oysters and beef liver have high amounts of iron.

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet. Introduction Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal is an evergreen shrub cultivated in tropical and subtropical areas of Asia, Africa, and Europe. It is commonly called by the Sanskrit name, ashwagandha, because the plant’s roots are said to smell like a wet horse (“ashwa” for horse and “gandha” for smell) . Ashwagandha is also sometimes known as winter cherry or Indian ginseng, although it does not belong to the ginseng family. Ashwagandha root has been used in the traditional Ayurvedic and Unani medicine systems of India as an adaptogen, which is loosely defined as a compound or product that increases the ability of a person to resist, adapt, or become resilient in nonspecific ways to biological, physical, or chemical stressors . The chemical composition of ashwagandha root and leaf differ . Most commercial ashwagandha supplements contain extracts from the plant’s root, although some contain extracts from both the root and leaf. The species name somnifera comes from the Latin word for sleep-inducing, signifying another purported property of this botanical . In addition to sleep, ashwagandha is commonly promoted for stress and anxiety reduction. Ashwagandha is rich in phytochemicals, including steroidal lactones (known as withanolides) and alkaloids. While withanolides are believed to be responsible for many of ashwagandha’s proposed effects, evidence from preclinical studies suggests that other, non-withanolide components may also be involved [6-8]. Efficacy Stress and anxiety Results from several clinical trials suggest that ashwagandha extracts may help reduce stress and anxiety. A 2021 systematic review identified seven studies that investigated the use of ashwagandha to treat stress and anxiety . A total of 491 adults, all from India, with either self-reported high stress and anxiety or a diagnosed anxiety disorder, were randomized to take ashwagandha or placebo for 6 to 8 weeks. Six of the studies used extracts made from ashwagandha root alone (three studies, KSM-66), root and leaf (two studies, Sensoril or Shoden), or unspecified parts (one study), while the seventh study used dried root powder made into granules. The ashwagandha dose varied from 240 to 1,250 mg/day of extract or 12,000 mg/day of whole root granules, which is equivalent to 6,000 mg of root powder. Overall, the studies found that ashwagandha significantly reduced stress and anxiety levels (subjectively measured by validated rating scales), reduced sleeplessness and fatigue, and reduced serum cortisol levels (a stress hormone) when compared with placebo. In several studies, the benefits appeared to be greater with doses of 500 to 600 mg/day than with lower doses. Results from most of the studies published after this 2021 review also suggest that ashwagandha has a beneficial impact on perceived stress [9-17]. For example, one clinical trial conducted in Florida included 60 men and women (mean age 34 years) who reported experiencing stress. Participants took capsules that contained 225 mg/day or 400 mg/day of a proprietary ashwagandha root and leaf extract (NooGandha) or placebo for 30 days . Compared with participants in the placebo group, those in both ashwagandha groups reported positive effects on stress, anxiety, depression, and food cravings as measured by validated rating scales. In addition, participants who took the 225-mg dose had lower saliva cortisol levels than those in the placebo group. At two health centers in India, 130 healthy men and women age 20 to 55 years with self-reported stress were randomized to take a sustained-released ashwagandha root extract (Prolanza) or placebo for 90 days . The extract was standardized to contain 15 mg withanolides per 300-mg capsule, and participants took one capsule daily. Compared with those who received placebo, participants who took ashwagandha extract reported improvements in stress levels and sleep quality as measured by validated rating scales. They also had lower serum cortisol levels. In addition, participants reported improvements in psychological well-being, memory, and focus. Another study in India randomized 54 participants with mild to moderate stress and anxiety to receive either ashwagandha root extract (Shagandha) or placebo . The participants in the ashwagandha group were given tablets that were standardized to contain 2.5% withanolides; each tablet included 500 mg of the root extract and 5 mg of piperine. At day 60, participants in the ashwagandha group had significantly lower scores for stress and anxiety on two validated rating scales than those in the placebo group. In addition, the quality of life scores increased significantly for people in the ashwagandha group between baseline and day 60, and the researchers noted improvements in multitasking and concentration among the participants in this group. At the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, 60 students (age 18–50 years) were randomized to take an ashwagandha root extract (Gaia Herbs) or placebo for 30 days in a double-blind trial . The extract contained 2.5 mg withanolides per 350-mg capsule, and participants took two capsules daily. The investigators gathered qualitative, subjective information from participants during daily check-ins and focus groups. Participants who took ashwagandha root extract reported increased well-being, including a sense of calm; improved energy levels; heightened mental clarity; and enhanced sleep quality. While the descriptions of stress were comparable in both groups, participants who took ashwagandha were more likely to describe their stress as manageable compared with those taking placebo. Another randomized clinical trial included 120 healthy men and women (mean age 54–55 years) who were overweight or mildly obese and experiencing low energy and fatigue . Participants took an ashwagandha root extract (Witholytin, which contains 200 mg hydroalcoholic extract of ashwagandha root standardized to 1.5% withanolides) or placebo twice daily for 12 weeks. Compared with placebo, ashwagandha did not reduce perceived stress, but it did reduce fatigue. A daily dose of 300 to 600 mg ashwagandha root extract (standardized to 5% withanolides) is provisionally recommended for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder by an international taskforce created by the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) . The taskforce issued this recommendation in 2022, and they noted that more research is needed to support a stronger recommendation. Sleep Research is limited, but the results from a few clinical trials suggest that ashwagandha extracts may help with sleep. For example, at one study center in India, 150 healthy men and women age 18 to 65 years with self-reported sleep problems characterized by insomnia and lack of restful sleep were randomized to take an ashwagandha root and leaf extract (Shoden) or placebo for 6 weeks . The extract was standardized to contain 21 mg of withanolide glycosides per 60-mg capsule, and participants took two capsules each day. Both groups reported improvements in sleep quality as measured by a validated rating scale, but the improvements were greater in the ashwagandha group (72%) than in the placebo group (29%). In addition, participants who took ashwagandha extract showed improvements in sleep efficiency (time in bed spent in sleep), total sleep time, sleep latency (time taken to fall asleep), and awakening after sleep onset as assessed by actigraphy, which involves wearing a watch monitor on the wrist to measure body motion. They also reported improvements in quality of life. In another trial conducted in India, 80 healthy men and women age 18 to 50 years, half of them with insomnia, were randomized to take an ashwagandha root extract (KSM-66) or placebo for 8 weeks . The extract was standardized to a withanolide content of more than 5% per 300-mg capsule, and participants took two capsules each day. Participants with insomnia who took ashwagandha extract showed improvements in sleep quality, sleep onset latency, mental alertness on rising, and perceived anxiety symptoms compared with those taking placebo, as measured by actigraphy and validated rating scales. Participants without insomnia who took ashwagandha also reported that ashwagandha improved their sleep but not their perceived anxiety symptoms or their mental alertness on awakening. A 2021 systematic review and meta-analysis included five studies (including the two described above) that investigated using ashwagandha to promote sleep . All the studies were conducted in India. A total of 372 adults, either self-described as healthy or with insomnia, took ashwagandha or placebo for 6 to 12 weeks. The dose of the ashwagandha supplement used in these studies ranged from 250 to 600 mg/day as a root extract (KSM-66) or, in one study, 120 mg/day of a root and leaf extract (Shoden). Overall, the studies found that ashwagandha extract had a small but significant effect on improving sleep compared with placebo. The benefits were more prominent when the dose was 600 mg/day and when the treatment duration was at least 8 weeks. Benefits were also more prominent in participants with insomnia. Safety In the studies described above and in many other clinical trials, ashwagandha has been well tolerated by participants for up to about 3 months of use. Common side effects are mild and include stomach upset, loose stools, nausea, and drowsiness . Increased heart rate variability has also been reported . Evidence on the safety of using ashwagandha over many months or years is lacking. There are a few reports of more serious side effects associated with ashwagandha use, including adverse effects on liver function . In a 2017 report of liver injury that was associated with ashwagandha use, a 20-year-old man in Japan developed liver dysfunction and hyperbilirubinemia after using ashwagandha (plant part and dose not specified) in combination with multiple antianxiety drugs . Since then, the use of ashwagandha has been linked to acute liver injury in other individuals, some of whom had pre-existing liver disease [24-28]. These include five cases of people (three men and two women, age range 21–62 years) who reportedly took supplements that contained 450 to 1,350 mg ashwagandha (plant part not specified) daily over the course of 1 week to 4 months and experienced signs of liver injury, such as jaundice, pruritus, nausea, lethargy, abdominal discomfort, and hyperbilirubinemia . In these cases and others, the conditions of the individuals improved over time after they stopped taking the supplement; some also received medical treatment [23,25-27]. However, the contents of the products that the individuals took were not independently verified in all cases, and some products were combination products that contained ashwagandha and other ingredients. Some research suggests that ashwagandha might affect thyroid function. In one study, three adult men who took 500 mg/day of a standardized ashwagandha root and leaf extract for 8 weeks had small increases in blood thyroxine (T4) levels . A small clinical trial with 50 participants with subclinical hypothyroidism found that ashwagandha root extract, at a dose of 300 mg twice daily for 8 weeks, lowered serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and increased triiodothyronine (T3) and T4 levels compared with placebo . Three case reports have also described thyrotoxicosis in women who were taking ashwagandha extract (age range 32–73 years) . However, the doses of ashwagandha were not specified in two of these case reports, and the third case involved an unusually high dose (1,950 mg/day for more than 2 months) . Discontinuing ashwagandha resolved the symptoms of thyrotoxicosis in all three cases. These findings suggest that ashwagandha might interact with thyroid hormone medications. Ashwagandha might also interact with other medications, including antidiabetes medications, antihypertensives, immunosuppressants, and sedatives . Some experts advise against the use of ashwagandha by women who are pregnant because some reports have suggested that it has the potential to cause spontaneous abortion [8,33-38]. A risk assessment released by the Technical University of Denmark in 2020 discussed both this potential abortifacient effect of ashwagandha and potential effects on thyroid and sex hormones; Denmark subsequently banned the use of ashwagandha in 2023 . The French Agency for Food, Environmental, and Occupational Health and Safety (ANSES) issued a statement in 2024 that recommended against using ashwagandha in certain populations, including pregnant and breastfeeding women and people with endocrine disorders . One of the sources for this information is a monograph on ashwagandha root published in 2000 by the American Herbal Pharmacopoeia (AHP) ; however, AHP has stated that their report has been misrepresented and that there is no evidence that ashwagandha root causes abortions . Ashwagandha use might also increase testosterone levels , so according to experts, it might not be safe for men with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer . Implications for use Several randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials, most of them fairly small in size and of short duration, have found that ashwagandha may reduce perceived stress and anxiety and improve the quality and duration of sleep . Because studies have used various ashwagandha preparations (with different extraction and standardization processes) and doses, it is difficult to identify specific extracts or recommended amounts . In addition, most studies have been conducted as part of a traditional medical system, so the potential effects of ashwagandha when used as a dietary supplement outside of that approach remain unclear. Ashwagandha appears to be well tolerated for up to 3 months of use. However, the efficacy and safety of long-term ashwagandha use over months or years for stress, anxiety, or sleep is not known. In addition, ashwagandha may have potential adverse effects on the liver and thyroid and might not be safe for men with prostate cancer or women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet. Introduction Biotin, a B vitamin, is an essential nutrient that is naturally present in some foods and available as a dietary supplement. This water-soluble vitamin is a cofactor for five carboxylases (propionyl-CoA carboxylase, pyruvate carboxylase, methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase [MCC], acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2) that catalyze critical steps in the metabolism of fatty acids, glucose, and amino acids [1-5]. Biotin also plays key roles in histone modifications, gene regulation (by modifying the activity of transcription factors), and cell signaling . Most biotin in foods is bound to protein, although some dietary biotin is in the free form . Gastrointestinal proteases and peptidases break down the protein-bound forms of ingested biotin into biocytin and biotin-oligopeptides, which undergo further processing by biotinidase, an enzyme, in the intestinal lumen to release free biotin . The free biotin is then absorbed in the small intestine, and most biotin is stored in the liver . A limited number of reliable indicators of biotin status is available . In healthy adults, the concentration of biotin is 133–329 pmol/L in serum and 18–127 nmol/24 hours in urine . Abnormally low urinary excretion of biotin is an indicator of biotin deficiency, as is abnormally high excretion of 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid (higher than 3.3 mmol/mol creatinine) or 3-hydroxyisovalerylcarnitine (higher than 0.06 mmol/mol creatinine) resulting from reduced activity of MCC . The most reliable individual markers of biotin status, including deficiency and sufficiency, are biotinylated MCC and propionyl-CoA carboxylase in white blood cells . Oral administration of large doses of biotin increases serum concentrations of biotin and its metabolites . However, serum concentrations of biotin and its catabolites are not good indicators of marginal biotin deficiency because they do not decrease sufficiently in people with marginal biotin deficiency for these changes to be detectable with existing tests . Recommended Intakes Intake recommendations for biotin and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine . DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following: Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects The FNB found the available data to be insufficient to derive an EAR and RDA for biotin. For this reason, the FNB established only AIs for biotin. The FNB based its determination of AIs for all populations on the amount of biotin in human milk consumed by infants and then used body weight to extrapolate AIs for other groups . Table 1 lists the current AIs for biotin . Table 1: Adequate Intakes (AIs) for Biotin Birth to 6 months: Male: 5 mcg, Female: 5 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  7–12 months: Male: 6 mcg, Female: 6 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  1–3 years: Male: 8 mcg, Female: 8 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  4–8 years: Male: 12 mcg, Female: 12 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  9–13 years: Male: 20 mcg, Female: 20 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  14–18 years: Male: 25 mcg, Female: 25 mcg, Pregnancy: 30 mcg, Lactation: 35 mcg 19+ years: Male: 30 mcg, Female: 30 mcg, Pregnancy: 30 mcg, Lactation: 35 mcg Sources of Biotin Food Many foods contain some biotin. Foods that contain the most biotin include organ meats, eggs, fish, meat, seeds, nuts, and certain vegetables (such as sweet potatoes) . The biotin content of food can vary; for example, plant variety and season can affect the biotin content of cereal grains, and certain processing techniques (e.g., canning) can reduce the biotin content of foods . Dietary avidin, a glycoprotein in raw egg whites, binds tightly to dietary biotin and prevents biotin’s absorption in the gastrointestinal tract . Cooking denatures avidin, making it unable to interfere with biotin absorption . Several food sources of biotin are listed in Table 2. Table 2: Biotin Content of Selected Foods Beef liver, cooked, 3 ounces: Micrograms (mcg) per serving: 30.8, Percent DV*: 103 Egg, whole, cooked: Micrograms (mcg) per serving: 10.0, Percent DV*: 33 Salmon, pink, canned in water, 3 ounces: Micrograms (mcg) per serving: 5.0, Percent DV*: 17 Pork chop, cooked, 3 ounces: Micrograms (mcg) per serving: 3.8, Percent DV*: 13 Hamburger patty, cooked, 3 ounces: Micrograms (mcg) per serving: 3.8, Percent DV*: 13 Sunflower seeds, roasted, ¼ cup: Micrograms (mcg) per serving: 2.6, Percent DV*: 9 Sweet potato, cooked, ½ cup: Micrograms (mcg) per serving: 2.4, Percent DV*: 8 Almonds, roasted, ¼ cup: Micrograms (mcg) per serving: 1.5, Percent DV*: 5 Tuna, canned in water, 3 ounces: Micrograms (mcg) per serving: 0.6, Percent DV*: 2 Spinach, boiled, ½ cup: Micrograms (mcg) per serving: 0.5, Percent DV*: 2 Broccoli, fresh, ½ cup: Micrograms (mcg) per serving: 0.4, Percent DV*: 1 Cheddar cheese, mild, 1 ounce: Micrograms (mcg) per serving: 0.4, Percent DV*: 1 Milk, 2%, 1 cup: Micrograms (mcg) per serving: 0.3, Percent DV*: 1 Plain yogurt, 1 cup: Micrograms (mcg) per serving: 0.2, Percent DV*: 1 Oatmeal, 1 cup: Micrograms (mcg) per serving: 0.2, Percent DV*: 1 Banana, ½ cup: Micrograms (mcg) per serving: 0.2, Percent DV*: 1 Whole wheat bread, 1 slice: Micrograms (mcg) per serving: 0.0, Percent DV*: 0 Apple, ½ cup: Micrograms (mcg) per serving: 0.0, Percent DV*: 0 *DV = Daily Value. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for biotin is 30 mcg for adults and children age 4 years and older . FDA does not require food labels to list biotin content unless biotin has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) FoodData Central does not list the biotin content of foods or provide lists of foods containing biotin. Dietary supplements Biotin is available in dietary supplements containing biotin only, in supplements containing combinations of B-complex vitamins, and in some multivitamin/mineral products . The absorption rate of oral, free biotin is 100%, even when people consume pharmacologic doses of up to 20 mg/day biotin . Biotin Intakes and Status Although there are no nationally representative estimates of biotin intakes in the United States, the average biotin intake from foods in other western populations is about 35–70 mcg/day, indicating that most people in these countries consume adequate amounts of biotin . Biotin Deficiency Biotin deficiency is rare , and severe biotin deficiency in healthy individuals eating a normal mixed diet has never been reported . The signs and symptoms of biotin deficiency typically appear gradually and can include thinning hair with progression to loss of all hair on the body; scaly, red rash around body openings (eyes, nose, mouth, and perineum); conjunctivitis; ketolactic acidosis (which occurs when lactate production exceeds lactate clearance) and aciduria (abnormal amounts of acid in urine); seizures; skin infection; brittle nails; neurological findings (e.g., depression, lethargy, hallucinations, and paresthesias of the extremities) in adults; and hypotonia, lethargy, and developmental delay in infants . The rash and unusual distribution of facial fat in people with biotin deficiency is known as biotin deficiency facies . Groups at Risk of Biotin Inadequacy The following groups are among those most likely to have inadequate biotin status. Individuals with biotinidase deficiency Biotinidase deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that prevents the body from releasing free biotin, leading to biotin deficiency despite normal intake. Without treatment, biotinidase deficiency produces neurological and cutaneous symptoms, and profound biotinidase deficiency can lead to coma or death . Because treatment with oral biotin starting at birth (or before symptoms develop) and continuing for the rest of the person’s life can prevent these symptoms, all newborns in the United States and many other countries are screened for this disorder . Individuals with chronic alcohol exposure Chronic exposure to alcohol inhibits the absorption of biotin . Plasma biotin concentrations are low in 15% of people with chronic alcoholism . Pregnant and breastfeeding women At least a third of pregnant women develop marginal biotin deficiency in spite of normal biotin intakes; plasma and breastmilk concentrations of biotin decrease in lactating women, even when their dietary biotin intakes exceed the AI . Additional research is needed to understand the clinical significance of these findings. Biotin and Health Hair, nail, and skin health Signs of biotin deficiency include skin rashes, hair loss, and brittle nails . Therefore, biotin supplements are often promoted for hair, skin, and nail health . However, these claims are supported, at best, by only a few case reports and small studies. The evidence on biotin supplementation to treat brittle nails includes three small studies that did not include a placebo group, and these reports do not indicate the baseline biotin status of study participants. One of these studies assessed the effects of 2.5 mg/day biotin for 6–15 months in 22 women with brittle, splitting, or soft nails and 10 healthy volunteers . In the eight patients with brittle nails whose nail samples were obtained immediately before and after biotin supplementation, nail thickness increased by 25%. In the 14 patients with brittle nails whose nail specimens were obtained 2–4 months after starting treatment and 1–4 months after ending treatment, nail thickness increased by 7%, a difference that was not statistically significant. In the second study, 2.5 mg biotin daily for an average of 5.5 months in 45 patients with thin and brittle fingernails resulted in firmer and harder fingernails in 41 of the patients (91%) . Finally, the third, retrospective study in 35 patients with brittle nails found that 2.5 mg/day biotin for 6–15 months resulted in clinical improvement in 22 of the 35 patients (63%) . Only case reports are available to support claims that biotin supplements can promote hair health, and these reports were only in children . These studies found that 3–5 mg/day biotin in children with uncombable hair syndrome (a rare disorder of the hair shaft) significantly improved hair health after 3–4 months. The evidence supporting the use of biotin supplements to support skin health is equally limited to a small number of case reports, all in infants, showing that 100 mcg to 10 mg/day resulted in dramatic improvements in rash or dermatitis as well as alopecia . Future studies are needed to determine whether biotin supplements might improve hair, nail, and skin health, especially among healthy individuals. Health Risks from Excessive Biotin The FNB was unable to establish ULs for biotin because there is no evidence in humans that biotin is toxic at high intakes . Several studies have found no adverse effects of 10–50 mg/day biotin, and up to 200 mg/day oral biotin or 20 mg/day intravenously in patients with biotinidase deficiency do not produce symptoms of toxicity . High biotin intakes, and potentially even intakes greater than the AI, may pose another type of health risk . Supplementing with biotin beyond recommended intakes can cause clinically significant falsely high or falsely low laboratory test results, depending on the test. These incorrect results may lead to inappropriate patient management or misdiagnosis of a medical condition. The following section has more details on these interactions. Interactions with Laboratory Tests Very high intakes of biotin may interfere with diagnostic assays that use biotin-streptavidin technology and are commonly used to measure levels of hormones (such as thyroid hormone) and other analytes such as 25-hydroxyvitamin D, producing falsely normal or abnormal results . As a result, a few recent case reports have described findings falsely indicating Graves' disease and severe hyperthyroidism in patients taking 10–300 mg biotin per day, including six children receiving high doses of biotin (2–15 mg/kg body weight per day) to treat inherited metabolic diseases [33-37]. Even a single 10 mg dose of biotin has interfered with thyroid function tests administered within 24 hours of taking the supplement . A small study in six healthy adults who took 10 mg/day of supplemental biotin for 1 week found interference in several biotinylated assays, including falsely decreased levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (which could lead to a misdiagnosis of thyrotoxicosis) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (which could result in a failure to identify congestive heart failure) . According to FDA, a patient with a high intake of supplemental biotin died following a troponin test (to help diagnose a heart attack) that gave a falsely low result because the test was subject to biotin interference . FDA advises health care providers to ask their patients about any supplements they may be taking that contain biotin and to consider biotin interference as a possible source of error if laboratory test results do not match the clinical presentation of the patient . Interactions with Medications Biotin can interact with certain medications, and some medications can have an adverse effect on biotin levels. One example is provided below. Individuals taking this and other medications on a regular basis should discuss their biotin status with their health care providers. Anticonvulsants In a study in 264 people with epilepsy, anticonvulsant treatment for at least 1 year was associated with significantly lower serum biotin levels than in control group patients . The anticonvulsants used included carbamazepine (Tegretol, Carbatrol, Epitol, Equetro), primidone (Mysoline), phenytoin (Dilantin, Phenytek), and phenobarbital (Luminal, Solfoton) as well as combinations of these medications. A few other, smaller studies have found similar results . The reason could be that anticonvulsant treatment increases biotin catabolism, which leads to reduced biotin status and inhibition of intestinal biotin absorption . Biotin and Healthful Diets The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\" For more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that Includes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils. Some fruits, vegetables, dairy products, and whole grains contain biotin.

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet. Introduction Vitamin A is the name of a group of fat-soluble retinoids, primarily retinol and retinyl esters . Vitamin A is involved in immune function, cellular communication, growth and development, and male and female reproduction [1-3]. Vitamin A supports cell growth and differentiation, playing a critical role in the normal formation and maintenance of the heart, lungs, eyes, and other organs . Vitamin A is also critical for vision as an essential component of rhodopsin, the light-sensitive protein in the retina that responds to light entering the eye, and because it supports the normal differentiation and functioning of the conjunctival membranes and cornea . The human diet contains two sources for vitamin A: preformed vitamin A (retinol and retinyl esters) and provitamin A carotenoids . Preformed vitamin A is found in foods from animal sources, including dairy products, eggs, fish, and organ meats . Provitamin A carotenoids are plant pigments that include beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, and beta-cryptoxanthin . The body converts provitamin A carotenoids into vitamin A in the intestine via the beta-carotene monooxygenase type 1 BCMO1 enzyme , although conversion rates may have genetic variability . Other carotenoids in food, such as lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin, are not converted into vitamin A and are referred to as non-provitamin A carotenoids; they might have other important activities not involving vitamin A formation . The various forms of vitamin A are solubilized into micelles in the intestinal lumen and absorbed by duodenal mucosal cells . Retinyl esters and provitamin A carotenoids are converted to retinol after uptake into the lumen (for retinyl esters) or absorption (for provitamin A carotenoids). Retinol is then oxidized to retinal and retinoic acid, the two main active vitamin A metabolites in the body . Most of the body’s vitamin A is stored in the liver in the form of retinyl esters . Retinol and carotenoid levels are typically measured in plasma or serum because blood samples are easy to collect . However, these levels are not always reliable indicators of vitamin A status because they do not decline until vitamin A levels in the liver and other storage sites are almost depleted and because acute and chronic infections can decrease serum and plasma retinol concentrations . Most vitamin A is stored in the liver, so measuring vitamin A levels in the liver is the best way to assess vitamin A adequacy . In clinical studies, specialized research laboratories can measure liver vitamin A reserves indirectly using isotope-dilution or dose-response methods, in which plasma levels of retinol, a tracer surrogate, or both are measured over several days after the administration of vitamin A . In clinical practice, plasma retinol levels alone can be used to document significant deficiency. A serum or plasma retinol concentration of 20 mcg/dL (0.70 micromoles/L) or less frequently reflects moderate vitamin A deficiency, and a level of 10 mcg/dL (0.35 micromoles/L) or less is considered an indicator of severe vitamin A deficiency . Recommended Intakes Intake recommendations for vitamin A and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine . DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following: Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects RDAs for vitamin A are given as retinol activity equivalents (RAE) to account for the different bioactivities of retinol and provitamin A carotenoids, all of which are converted by the body into retinol (see Table 1). One mcg RAE is equivalent to 1 mcg retinol, 2 mcg supplemental beta-carotene, 12 mcg dietary beta-carotene, or 24 mcg dietary alpha-carotene or beta-cryptoxanthin . Table 1: Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for Vitamin A Birth to 6 months*: Male: 400 mcg RAE, Female: 400 mcg RAE, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  7–12 months*: Male: 500 mcg RAE, Female: 500 mcg RAE, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  1–3 years: Male: 300 mcg RAE, Female: 300 mcg RAE, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  4–8 years: Male: 400 mcg RAE, Female: 400 mcg RAE, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  9–13 years: Male: 600 mcg RAE, Female: 600 mcg RAE, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  14–18 years: Male: 900 mcg RAE, Female: 700 mcg RAE, Pregnancy: 750 mcg RAE, Lactation: 1,200 mcg RAE 19–50 years: Male: 900 mcg RAE, Female: 700 mcg RAE, Pregnancy: 770 mcg RAE, Lactation: 1,300 mcg RAE 51+ years: Male: 900 mcg RAE, Female: 700 mcg RAE, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  *AI, equivalent to the mean intake of vitamin A in healthy, breastfed infants. The units of measurement for vitamin A are now mcg RAE, but International Units (IUs) were previously used . To convert IU to mcg RAE, use the following [11-13]: 1 IU retinol = 0.3 mcg RAE 1 IU supplemental beta-carotene = 0.3 mcg RAE 1 IU dietary beta-carotene = 0.05 mcg RAE 1 IU dietary alpha-carotene or beta-cryptoxanthin = 0.025 mcg RAE 1 IU retinol = 0.3 mcg RAE 1 IU supplemental beta-carotene = 0.3 mcg RAE 1 IU dietary beta-carotene = 0.05 mcg RAE 1 IU dietary alpha-carotene or beta-cryptoxanthin = 0.025 mcg RAE RAE can only be directly converted into IUs if the sources of vitamin A are known. For example, the RDA of 900 mcg RAE for adolescent and adult men is equivalent to 3,000 IU if the food or supplement source is preformed vitamin A (retinol) or if the supplement source is beta-carotene. This RDA is also equivalent to 18,000 IU beta-carotene from food or to 36,000 IU alpha-carotene or beta-cryptoxanthin from food. Therefore, a mixed diet containing 900 mcg RAE provides between 3,000 and 36,000 IU vitamin A, depending on the foods consumed. Sources of Vitamin A Food Concentrations of preformed vitamin A are highest in liver, fish, eggs, and dairy products . Most dietary provitamin A in the U.S. diet comes from leafy green vegetables, orange and yellow vegetables, tomato products, fruits, and some vegetable oils . Vitamin A is routinely added to some foods, including milk and margarine . Some ready-to-eat cereals are also fortified with vitamin A. About 65% to 80% of vitamin A consumed in the United States and other high-income countries comes from preformed vitamin A, whereas provitamin A is the main form consumed in low-income countries, where diets include more plant-based foods . Among U.S. children and adolescents, enriched and fortified foods account for 34%–40% of vitamin A intakes from food . The body might absorb up to 75% to 100% of retinol and, in most cases, 10% to 30% of beta-carotene from foods . Cooking and heat treatment can increase the bioavailability of beta-carotene from foods . Table 2 lists a variety of foods and their vitamin A content per serving. The foods from animal sources in Table 2 contain primarily preformed vitamin A, the plant-based foods have provitamin A, and the foods with a mixture of ingredients from animals and plants contain both preformed vitamin A and provitamin A.

Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for vitamin A is 900 mcg RAE for adults and children age 4 years and older , where 1 mcg RAE = 1 mcg retinol, 2 mcg beta-carotene from supplements, 12 mcg beta-carotene from foods, 24 mcg alpha-carotene, or 24 mcg beta-cryptoxanthin. FDA does not require food labels to list vitamin A content unless vitamin A has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) FoodData Central lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides a comprehensive list of foods containing vitamin A arranged by nutrient content and by food name. Dietary supplements Vitamin A is available in stand-alone supplements and most multivitamins, often in the form of retinyl acetate, retinyl palmitate, provitamin A beta-carotene, or a combination . Amounts of vitamin A in supplements vary widely, but 3,000 mcg RAE (333% of the DV) is common . Multivitamins commonly have somewhat lower amounts, often 750 to 1,050 mcg RAE (83% to 117% of the DV). The absorption of preformed vitamin A esters from dietary supplements is 70%–90%, and that of beta-carotene ranges from 8.7% to 65% . Vitamin A Intakes and Status Average daily intakes of vitamin A from foods and beverages in the United States were 682 mcg RAE for men age 20 and older and 616 mcg RAE for women in 2017–2018, according to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) . For children age 2–19, mean daily intakes of vitamin A from foods and beverages ranged from 497 to 680 mcg RAE. An analysis of biochemical data from 2003–2006 NHANES data indicates that less than 1% of the U.S. population has a serum retinol level of less than 20 mcg/dL, which indicates that vitamin A deficiency is uncommon in the U.S. population . Data from NHANES III, conducted from 1988 to 1994, showed that approximately 26% of the vitamin A in RAEs consumed by men and 34% of that consumed by women in the United States comes from provitamin A carotenoids . The remainder comes from preformed vitamin A, mostly in the form of retinyl esters. About 12% to 40% of the U.S. population, depending on age, uses supplements containing vitamin A . Adults age 71 years or older and children younger than 9 are more likely than members of other age groups to take supplements containing vitamin A. Vitamin A Deficiency Frank vitamin A deficiency is rare in the United States. However, vitamin A deficiency is still common in many developing countries, often as a result of limited access to foods containing preformed vitamin A from animal-based food sources and to foods containing provitamin A carotenoids because of poverty or traditional diets . A pooled analysis of population-based surveys from 138 low-income and middle-income countries found that 29% of children age 6 months to 5 years had vitamin A deficiency in 2013 . Deficiency rates were highest in sub-Saharan Africa (48%) and South Asia (44%). In addition, approximately 10% to 20% of pregnant women in low-income countries have vitamin A deficiency . Limited research suggests that vitamin A deficiency may also be influenced by genetic variability in conversion rates of beta-carotene to vitamin A. Certain polymorphisms in the BCMO1 gene have been found to reduce the activity of the BCMO1 enzyme in humans , and a study in the Philippines among 693 children and adolescents found an inverse association between vitamin A status and the A379V TT variant in the BCMO1 gene . The most common clinical sign of vitamin A deficiency is xerophthalmia, which develops after plasma retinol has been low and the eye’s vitamin A reserves have become depleted. The first sign is night blindness, or the inability to see in low light or darkness as a result of low rhodopsin levels in the retina . Xerophthalmia also affects the cornea and can eventually lead to permanent blindness; vitamin A deficiency is one of the top causes of preventable blindness in children . Chronic vitamin A deficiency has also been associated with abnormal lung development, respiratory diseases (such as pneumonia), and an increased risk of anemia and death . Another effect of chronic vitamin A deficiency is increased severity and mortality risk of infections (particularly measles and infection-associated diarrhea) . In 2013, 94,500 children in low-income and middle-income countries died of diarrhea and 11,200 died of measles as a result of vitamin A deficiency . More than 95% of deaths attributable to vitamin A deficiency occurred in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, where vitamin A deficiency was responsible for 2% of all deaths in children younger than 5 years . Groups at Risk of Vitamin A Inadequacy The following groups are among those most likely to have inadequate intakes of vitamin A. Premature infants Preterm infants have low liver stores of vitamin A at birth, and their plasma concentrations of retinol often remain low throughout the first year of life . Preterm infants with vitamin A deficiency have a higher risk of eye and chronic lung diseases . However, in high-income countries, clinical vitamin A deficiency is rare in infants and occurs only in those with malabsorption disorders . Infants, children, and pregnant and lactating women in low-income and middle-income countries Pregnant women need extra vitamin A for fetal growth and tissue maintenance and to support their own metabolism [35-37]. The breast milk of lactating women with adequate vitamin A intakes contains sufficient amounts of vitamin A to meet infants’ needs for the first 6 months of life . However, in people with vitamin A deficiency, the vitamin A content of breast milk is not sufficient to maintain adequate vitamin A stores in infants who are exclusively breastfed . About 190 million preschool-age children (one-third of all children in this age group), mostly in Africa and Southeast Asia, have vitamin A deficiency, according to the World Health Organization . They have a higher risk of visual impairment and of illness and death from childhood infections, such as measles and infections that cause diarrheal diseases . The World Health Organization estimates that 9.8 million pregnant women (15% of all pregnant women) around the world, mostly in low-income and middle-income countries, have xerophthalmia as a result of vitamin A deficiency . People with cystic fibrosis Up to 90% of people with cystic fibrosis have pancreatic insufficiency, which increases their risk of vitamin A deficiency due to difficulty absorbing fat . Studies in Australia and the Netherlands indicate that 2% to 13% of children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis have vitamin A deficiency . As a result, standard care for cystic fibrosis includes lifelong treatment with vitamin A (daily amounts of 750 mcg RAE to 3,000 mcg RAE, depending on age, are recommended in the United States and Australia), other fat-soluble vitamins, and pancreatic enzymes . Individuals with gastrointestinal disorders Approximately one-quarter of children with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis have vitamin A deficiency; adults with these disorders, especially those who have had the disorder for several years, also have a higher risk of vitamin A deficiency . Although some evidence supports the use of vitamin A supplements in people with these disorders , other research has found that supplementation offers no benefit . Some children and adults with newly diagnosed celiac disease also have vitamin A deficiency; a gluten-free diet can, but does not always, eliminate this deficiency [48-51]. Vitamin A and Health This section focuses on three diseases and disorders in which vitamin A or carotenoids might play a role: cancer, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and measles. Cancer Because of its role in regulating cell growth and differentiation, several studies have examined the association between vitamin A and various types of cancer. However, the relationship between serum vitamin A levels or vitamin A supplementation and cancer risk or cancer-related death is unclear. This fact sheet does not include studies of all-trans retinoic acid, a vitamin A metabolite that is used as a drug in high doses to treat a form of leukemia . Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies have shown that higher dietary intakes of retinol, carotenoids, fruits and vegetables, or a combination are associated with a lower risk of lung cancer , non-Hodgkin lymphoma , pancreatic cancer , oral cavity cancer , laryngeal cancer , esophageal cancer , ovarian cancer , glioma , and bladder cancer . However, other observational studies have found no association between intakes of different forms of vitamin A and risk of liver cancer , non-Hodgkin lymphoma , colorectal cancer , prostate cancer , or all cancers . Some clinical trial evidence suggests that supplemental vitamin A might reduce the risk of certain cancers but increase the risk of other forms of cancer, cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality, and all-cause mortality. Examples are provided below. The Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) included 18,314 male and female current and former smokers (with at least a 20 pack-year history [equivalent to smoking 1 pack per day for 20 years or 2 packs per day for 10 years, for example] of cigarette smoking) as well as some men occupationally exposed to asbestos (who also have a higher risk of lung cancer), all age 45–74 years. The study randomized participants to take supplements containing 30 mg beta-carotene plus 25,000 IU (7,500 mcg RAE) retinyl palmitate or a placebo daily for about 6 years to evaluate the potential effects on lung cancer risk . The trial was ended prematurely after a mean of 4 years, partly because the supplements were unexpectedly found to have increased lung cancer risk by 28% and death from lung cancer by 46%; the supplements also increased the risk of all-cause mortality by 17%. A subsequent study followed CARET participants for an additional 6 years after they stopped taking the study supplements . During this time, the differences in lung cancer risk between the intervention and placebo groups were no longer statistically significant, with one exception: women in the intervention group had a 33% higher risk of lung cancer. In a separate analysis of CARET study data, men who took the two supplements had a 35% lower risk of nonaggressive prostate cancer during the 4-year active trial but not during the 6-year postintervention period. In contrast, men who took these two supplements in addition to another self-prescribed supplement (typically a multivitamin) had a 52% higher risk of aggressive prostate cancer during the active trial, but not during the postintervention period . The Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene (ATBC) Cancer Prevention Study also found that beta-carotene supplements increased the risk of lung cancer in smokers . In this study, 29,133 male smokers age 50–69 years who smoked an average of 20.4 cigarettes a day for an average of 35.9 years took a supplement containing 50 mg/day alpha-tocopherol, 20 mg/day beta-carotene, both alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene, or a placebo for 5–8 years. The beta-carotene supplements increased the risk of lung cancer by 18%, although they had little to no effect on the incidence of other cancers. The overall rate of death, primarily from lung cancer and ischemic heart disease, was 8% higher in participants who took beta-carotene. A subsequent study followed 25,563 of these participants for an additional 18 years . During this period, participants were no longer taking the supplements, but most continued to smoke. Participants who had taken beta-carotene in the original trial did not have a higher risk of lung cancer, but they had a 20% higher risk of death due to prostate cancer. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) was a 5-year randomized clinical trial with 4,203 participants age 50–85 years examining the effects on AMD of a dietary supplement containing several ingredients with or without beta-carotene (15 mg [7,500 mcg RAE]) . No current smokers received the supplements containing beta-carotene. At the end of the trial, more lung cancers were discovered in the beta-carotene group than in the no beta-carotene group (23 vs. 11 cases), and 31 of the 34 affected were former smokers. In a follow-up analysis of 3,882 of the participants 5 years after the end of AREDS2 (during which they took the AREDS2 formulation containing lutein and zeaxanthin instead of beta-carotene), the increased lung cancer risk persisted, with an 82% higher risk among participants who took the supplement containing beta-carotene during the 5-year AREDS2 trial . Three other clinical trials have found no relationship between taking vitamin A or beta-carotene supplements and lung cancer incidence or mortality . One trial randomized 22,071 male physicians age 40–84 years to take 50 mg beta carotene on alternate days or a placebo for 12 years . Eleven percent of the physicians were current smokers, and 38% were former smokers at the start of the study. The results showed no differences between the groups in number of cases of lung cancer or any malignant neoplasms or number of deaths from cancer. Another trial randomized 7,627 women (mean age 60.4 years) to take 50 mg beta-carotene on alternate days, 600 IU vitamin E on alternate days, 500 mg vitamin C daily, or a placebo for a mean of 9.4 years . Fifteen percent of the women were current smokers, and 41% were former smokers at the start of the study. None of the supplements had any significant effect on total cancer incidence or cancer mortality, including from lung cancer. A third trial included 29,584 healthy men and women age 40–69 years who were living in Linxian, China, where micronutrient deficiencies are common . The study randomized participants to take either a placebo or one of four vitamin and mineral combinations (including one providing retinol and zinc and another providing beta carotene, vitamin E, and selenium) for 5.25 years. The investigators followed participants for an additional 10 years after they stopped taking the supplements. The nutrient doses in the supplements were equivalent to or twice as high as U.S. recommended intakes, but the study report did not provide the exact doses. During both the intervention and follow-up periods, lung cancer death rates did not differ among the five groups, even when the investigators further analyzed the results for differences by age, sex, and smoking status. The CARET and ATBC study results suggest that large supplemental doses of beta-carotene with or without retinyl palmitate have detrimental effects in current or former smokers and workers exposed to asbestos. However, the other studies described above that used similar vitamin A doses but had smaller proportions of current or former smokers do not raise this concern. Among nonsmokers, beta-carotene and vitamin A supplements do not appear to affect the risk of cancer. Age-related macular degeneration AMD is the leading cause of significant vision loss in older people . AMD’s etiology involves complex interactions among genetic susceptibility, environmental factors (including exposure to oxidative stress), and normal aging . Because of the role of oxidative stress in AMD pathophysiology, supplements containing carotenoids with antioxidant functions, such as beta-carotene, lutein, and zeaxanthin, might be useful for preventing or treating this condition. Lutein and zeaxanthin (which are not precursors of vitamin A), in particular, accumulate in the retina, the tissue in the eye that is damaged by AMD. The AREDS trial found that participants with a high risk of developing advanced AMD (i.e., those who had intermediate AMD or who had advanced AMD in one eye) had a 25% lower risk of developing advanced AMD after they took a daily supplement containing beta-carotene (15 mg [7,500 mcg RAE]), vitamin E (180 mg [400 IU] dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate), vitamin C (500 mg), zinc (80 mg), and copper (2 mg) for 5 years than participants taking a placebo . The follow-up AREDS2 study confirmed the value of this supplement in reducing the progression of AMD over a median follow-up period of 5 years . However, this follow-up study showed that adding lutein (10 mg) and zeaxanthin (2 mg) or omega-3 fatty acids to the formulation produced no additional benefits. Importantly, the follow-up study also revealed that beta-carotene was not a required ingredient; the original AREDS formulation without beta-carotene provided the same protective effect against developing advanced AMD. In a more detailed analysis, participants with the lowest dietary intakes of lutein and zeaxanthin had a 26% lower risk of advanced AMD when they took a supplement containing these two carotenoids than those who did not take a supplement with these carotenoids . The risk of advanced AMD was also 18% lower in participants who took the modified AREDS supplement containing lutein and zeaxanthin but not beta-carotene than in participants who took the formulation with beta-carotene but not lutein or zeaxanthin. A subsequent study monitored dietary intakes of several nutrients in 4,504 AREDS participants and 3,738 AREDS2 participants (mean age 71 years) for a median of 10.2 years . Participants in the two highest quintiles of intakes for vitamin A, beta-carotene, or lutein and zeaxanthin had a lower risk of progression to late AMD. For example, the risk of late AMD was 18% lower among those in the fifth quintile for vitamin A intake and 20% lower among those in the fourth quintile than among those in the first quintile. At the end of the 5-year AREDS2 trial, participants were all offered the final AREDS2 formulation that included lutein and zeaxanthin in place of beta-carotene. Researchers followed up with 3,882 of these participants for an additional 5 years . After 10 years, participants who had taken the AREDS2 supplement with lutein and zeaxanthin had an additional 20% reduced risk of progression to late AMD compared with those who took the supplement containing beta-carotene. This finding confirmed the benefit of replacing beta-carotene with lutein and zeaxanthin. Individuals who have or are developing AMD should talk to their health care provider about their vitamin A intakes and the supplement formulations used in the AREDS studies. Measles In 2023, measles was responsible for about 107,500 deaths worldwide, mostly in young children in low-income countries . Vitamin A deficiency, which is rare in the United States, is a risk factor for severe measles . A World Health Organization analysis of data from 83 countries showed that 11,200 child deaths from measles were associated with vitamin A deficiency in 2013, and more than 95% of these deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia . Research suggests that vitamin A supplementation reduces the risk of measles in children who are at high risk of vitamin A deficiency. However, vitamin A supplementation does not appear to reduce the risk of death from measles. A 2022 Cochrane Review included six clinical trials that examined the effect of vitamin A supplementation on the risk of measles in children . These studies enrolled a total of 19,566 children age 6 months to 5 years who lived in low- and middle-income countries. Vitamin A doses ranged from 15,000 mcg RAE (50,000 IU) to 60,000 mcg RAE (200,000 IU), depending on age. Supplements were administered as a single dose or every 4 to 6 months. Vitamin A supplementation reduced the risk of new cases of measles by 50%. However, the same Cochrane Review found that vitamin A supplementation did not affect the risk of death due to measles, based on the results from six clinical trials in a total of 1,088,261 children. Health Risks from Excessive Vitamin A Because vitamin A is fat soluble, the body stores excess amounts, primarily in the liver, and these levels can accumulate. Acute vitamin A toxicity, also referred to as hypervitaminosis A, occurs within days to weeks after someone ingests one or a few very high doses (typically more than 100 times the RDA) . Resulting signs and symptoms typically include severe headache, blurred vision, nausea, dizziness, aching muscles, and coordination problems. In severe cases, cerebral spinal fluid pressure can increase, leading to drowsiness and, eventually, coma and even death . Chronic hypervitaminosis A (regular consumption of high doses) can cause dry skin, painful muscles and joints, fatigue, depression, and abnormal liver test results . Total intakes of preformed vitamin A that exceed the UL as well as some retinoid medications used as topical therapies (such as isotretinoin, used to treat severe acne, and etretinate, a treatment for severe psoriasis) can cause congenital birth defects . These birth defects can include malformations of the eye, skull, lungs, and heart . Experts advise women who are or might be pregnant and those who are lactating not to take high doses (more than 3,000 mcg RAE [10,000 IU] daily) of vitamin A supplements . Unlike preformed vitamin A, beta-carotene is not known to be teratogenic or lead to reproductive toxicity . The most common effect of long-term, excess beta-carotene is carotenodermia, a harmless condition in which the skin becomes yellow-orange . This condition can be reversed by discontinuing beta-carotene ingestion. However, the ATBC trial found that supplementation with a large amount of beta-carotene (20 mg/day), with or without 50 mg/day vitamin E, for 5–8 years increased the risk of lung cancer and mortality (mainly from lung cancer and ischemic heart disease) in male smokers . The CARET trial also showed that supplementation with a large amount of beta-carotene (30 mg/day) plus 7,500 mcg RAE (25,000 IU)/day retinyl palmitate for 4–8 years in current and former smokers as well as some men occupationally exposed to asbestos increased the risk of lung cancer and death from lung cancer . The FNB has not established ULs for beta-carotene and other provitamin A carotenoids . However, the FNB advises against the use of beta-carotene supplements for the general population, except as a provitamin A source to prevent vitamin A deficiency. Tolerable upper intake levels for preformed vitamin A The FNB has established ULs for preformed vitamin A that apply to both food and supplement intakes . The FNB based these ULs on the amounts associated with an increased risk of liver abnormalities in men and women, teratogenic effects, and several toxic effects in infants and children. Table 3: Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for Preformed Vitamin A * Birth to 12 months: Male: 600 mcg, Female: 600 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  1–3 years: Male: 600 mcg, Female: 600 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  4–8 years: Male: 900 mcg, Female: 900 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  9–13 years: Male: 1,700 mcg, Female: 1,700 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  14–18 years: Male: 2,800 mcg, Female: 2,800 mcg, Pregnancy: 2,800 mcg, Lactation: 2,800 mcg 19+ years: Male: 3,000 mcg, Female: 3,000 mcg, Pregnancy: 3,000 mcg, Lactation: 3,000 mcg *These ULs apply only to products from animal sources and supplements whose vitamin A comes entirely from retinol or its ester forms, such as retinyl palmitate. However, many dietary supplements (such as multivitamins) do not provide all of their vitamin A in retinol or its ester forms. For example, the vitamin A in some supplements consists partly or entirely of beta-carotene. In such cases, the percentage of retinol or retinyl ester in the supplement should be used to determine whether an individual’s vitamin A intake exceeds the UL. For example, a supplement whose label indicates that the product contains 3,000 mcg RAE vitamin A and that 60% of this vitamin A comes from beta-carotene (and therefore 40% comes from retinol or retinyl ester) provides 1,200 mcg RAE of preformed vitamin A. That amount is above the UL for children from birth to 8 years but below the UL for older children and adults. Interactions with Medications Vitamin A has the potential to interact with certain medications. In addition, several types of medications might adversely affect vitamin A levels. A few examples are provided below. Individuals taking these and other medications on a regular basis should discuss their vitamin A status with their health care providers. Orlistat (Alli, Xenical), a weight-loss treatment, can decrease the absorption of vitamin A, other fat-soluble vitamins, and beta-carotene, resulting in low plasma levels in some patients . The manufacturers of Alli and Xenical recommend that patients on orlistat take a multivitamin supplement containing vitamin A and beta-carotene as well as other fat-soluble vitamins . Retinoids Several synthetic retinoids derived from vitamin A are used orally as prescription medicines. Examples include the psoriasis treatment acitretin (Soriatane) and bexarotene (Targretin), used to treat the skin effects of T-cell lymphoma. Retinoids can increase the risk of hypervitaminosis A when taken in combination with vitamin A supplements . Vitamin A and Healthful Diets The federal government’s 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\" For more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy eating pattern as one that Includes a variety of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fat-free or low-fat milk and milk products, and oils. Many fruits, vegetables, and dairy products are good sources of vitamin A. Some ready-to-eat breakfast cereals are fortified with vitamin A. Includes a variety of protein foods, including seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs, legumes (beans and peas), nuts, seeds, and soy products. Beef liver contains high amounts of vitamin A.

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet. Introduction Vitamin B6 is a water-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in many foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement. It is the generic name for six compounds (vitamers) with vitamin B6 activity: pyridoxine, an alcohol; pyridoxal, an aldehyde; and pyridoxamine, which contains an amino group; and their respective 5'-phosphate esters. Pyridoxal 5' phosphate (PLP) and pyridoxamine 5' phosphate (PMP) are the active coenzyme forms of vitamin B6 . Substantial proportions of the naturally occurring pyridoxine in fruits, vegetables, and grains exist in glycosylated forms that exhibit reduced bioavailability . Vitamin B6 in coenzyme forms performs a wide variety of functions in the body and is extremely versatile, with involvement in more than 100 enzyme reactions, mostly concerned with protein metabolism . Both PLP and PMP are involved in amino acid metabolism, and PLP is also involved in the metabolism of one-carbon units, carbohydrates, and lipids . Vitamin B6 also plays a role in cognitive development through the biosynthesis of neurotransmitters and in maintaining normal levels of homocysteine, an amino acid in the blood . Vitamin B6 is involved in gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, immune function (for example, it promotes lymphocyte and interleukin-2 production), and hemoglobin formation . The human body absorbs vitamin B6 in the jejunum. Phosphorylated forms of the vitamin are dephosphorylated, and the pool of free vitamin B6 is absorbed by passive diffusion . Vitamin B6 concentrations can be measured directly by assessing concentrations of PLP; other vitamers; or total vitamin B6 in plasma, erythrocytes, or urine . Vitamin B6 concentrations can also be measured indirectly by assessing either erythrocyte aminotransferase saturation by PLP or tryptophan metabolites. Plasma PLP is the most common measure of vitamin B6 status. PLP concentrations of more than 30 nmol/L have been traditional indicators of adequate vitamin B6 status in adults . However, the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies (formerly National Academy of Sciences) used a plasma PLP level of 20 nmol/L as the major indicator of adequacy to calculate the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for adults . Recommended Intakes Intake recommendations for vitamin B6 and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the FNB . DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and gender, include the following: Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects. Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects. Table 1 lists the current RDAs for vitamin B6 . For infants from birth to 12 months, the FNB established an AI for vitamin B6 that is equivalent to the mean intake of vitamin B6 in healthy, breastfed infants. Table 1: Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for Vitamin B6 Birth to 6 months: Male: 0.1 mg*, Female: 0.1 mg*, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  7–12 months: Male: 0.3 mg*, Female: 0.3 mg*, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  1–3 years: Male: 0.5 mg, Female: 0.5 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  4–8 years: Male: 0.6 mg, Female: 0.6 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  9–13 years: Male: 1.0 mg, Female: 1.0 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  14–18 years: Male: 1.3 mg, Female: 1.2 mg, Pregnancy: 1.9 mg, Lactation: 2.0 mg 19–50 years: Male: 1.3 mg, Female: 1.3 mg, Pregnancy: 1.9 mg, Lactation: 2.0 mg 51+ years: Male: 1.7 mg, Female: 1.5 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  * Adequate Intake (AI) Sources of Vitamin B6 Food Vitamin B6 is found in a wide variety of foods . The richest sources of vitamin B6 include fish, beef liver and other organ meats, potatoes and other starchy vegetables, and fruit (other than citrus). In the United States, adults obtain most of their dietary vitamin B6 from fortified cereals, beef, poultry, starchy vegetables, and some noncitrus fruits . About 75% of vitamin B6 from a mixed diet is bioavailable . The table of selected food sources of vitamin B6 suggests many dietary sources of vitamin B6.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for vitamin B6 is 1.7 mg for adults and children age 4 years and older . FDA does not require food labels to list vitamin B6 content unless vitamin B6 has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) FoodData Central lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides a comprehensive list of foods containing vitamin B6 arranged by nutrient content and by food name. Dietary supplements Vitamin B6 is available in multivitamins, in supplements containing other B complex vitamins, and as a stand-alone supplement . The most common vitamin B6 vitamer in supplements is pyridoxine (in the form of pyridoxine hydrochloride [HCl]), although some supplements contain PLP. Vitamin B6 supplements are available in oral capsules or tablets (including sublingual and chewable tablets) and liquids. Absorption of vitamin B6 from supplements is similar to that from food sources and does not differ substantially among the various forms of supplements . Although the body absorbs large pharmacological doses of vitamin B6 well, it quickly eliminates most of the vitamin in the urine . About 28%–36% of the general population uses supplements containing vitamin B6 . Adults age 51 years or older and children younger than 9 are more likely than members of other age groups to take supplements containing vitamin B6. Vitamin B6 Intakes and Status Most children, adolescents, and adults in the United States consume the recommended amounts of vitamin B6, according to an analysis of data from the 2003–2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) . The average vitamin B6 intake is about 1.5 mg/day in women and 2 mg/day in men . However, 11% of vitamin B6 supplement users and 24% of people in the United States who do not take supplements containing vitamin B6 have low plasma PLP concentrations (less than 20 nmol/L) . In the 2003–2004 NHANES analysis, plasma PLP concentrations were low even in some groups that took 2.0–2.9 mg/day, which is higher than the current RDA. Among supplement users and nonusers, plasma PLP levels were much lower in women than men, non-Hispanic blacks than non-Hispanic whites, current smokers than never smokers, and people who were underweight than those of normal weight. Teenagers had the lowest vitamin B6 concentrations, followed by adults age 21–44 years. However, plasma PLP levels in the elderly were not particularly low, even in those who did not use supplements. Based on these data, the authors of this analysis concluded that the current RDAs might not guarantee adequate vitamin B6 status in many population groups . PLP concentrations tend to be low in people with alcohol dependence; those with obesity; and pregnant women, especially those with preeclampsia or eclampsia . They are also low in people with malabsorption syndromes such as celiac disease, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis . Vitamin B6 Deficiency Isolated vitamin B6 deficiency is uncommon; inadequate vitamin B6 status is usually associated with low concentrations of other B-complex vitamins, such as vitamin B12 and folic acid . Vitamin B6 deficiency causes biochemical changes that become more obvious as the deficiency progresses . Vitamin B6 deficiency is associated with microcytic anemia, electroencephalographic abnormalities, dermatitis with cheilosis (scaling on the lips and cracks at the corners of the mouth) and glossitis (swollen tongue), depression and confusion, and weakened immune function . Individuals with borderline vitamin B6 concentrations or mild deficiency might have no deficiency signs or symptoms for months or even years. In infants, vitamin B6 deficiency causes irritability, abnormally acute hearing, and convulsive seizures . End-stage renal diseases, chronic renal insufficiency, and other kidney diseases can cause vitamin B6 deficiency . In addition, vitamin B6 deficiency can result from malabsorption syndromes, such as celiac disease, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. Certain genetic diseases, such as homocystinuria, can also cause vitamin B6 deficiency . Some medications, such as antiepileptic drugs, can lead to deficiency over time. Groups at Risk of Vitamin B6 Inadequacy Frank vitamin B6 deficiencies are relatively rare in the United States but some individuals might have marginal vitamin B6 status . The following groups are among those most likely to have inadequate intakes of vitamin B6. Individuals with impaired renal function People with poor renal function, including those with end-stage renal disease and chronic renal insufficiency, often have low vitamin B6 concentrations . Plasma PLP concentrations are also low in patients receiving maintenance kidney dialysis or intermittent peritoneal dialysis, as well as those who have undergone a kidney transplant, perhaps due to increased metabolic clearance of PLP . Patients with kidney disease often show clinical symptoms similar to those of people with vitamin B6 deficiency . Individuals with autoimmune disorders People with rheumatoid arthritis often have low vitamin B6 concentrations, and vitamin B6 concentrations tend to decrease with increased disease severity . These low vitamin B6 levels are due to the inflammation caused by the disease and, in turn, increase the inflammation associated with the disease. Although vitamin B6 supplements can normalize vitamin B6 concentrations in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, they do not suppress the production of inflammatory cytokines or decrease levels of inflammatory markers . Patients with celiac disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and other malabsorptive autoimmune disorders tend to have low plasma PLP concentrations . The mechanisms for this effect are not known. However, celiac disease is associated with lower pyridoxine absorption, and low PLP concentrations in inflammatory bowel disease could be due to the inflammatory response . People with alcohol dependence Plasma PLP concentrations tend to be very low in people with alcohol dependence . Alcohol produces acetaldehyde, which decreases net PLP formation by cells and competes with PLP in protein binding . As a result, the PLP in cells might be more susceptible to hydrolysis by membrane-bound phosphatase. People with alcohol dependence might benefit from pyridoxine supplementation . Vitamin B6 and Health Cardiovascular disease Scientists have hypothesized that certain B vitamins (folic acid, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6) might reduce cardiovascular disease risk by lowering homocysteine levels . Therefore, several clinical trials have assessed the safety and efficacy of supplemental doses of B vitamins to reduce heart disease risk. Evaluating the impact of vitamin B6 from many of these trials is challenging because these studies also included folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation. For example, the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation 2 (HOPE 2) trial, which included more than 5,500 adults with known cardiovascular disease, found that supplementation for 5 years with vitamin B6 (50 mg/day), vitamin B12 (1 mg/day), and folic acid (2.5 mg/day) reduced homocysteine levels and decreased stroke risk by about 25%, but the study did not include a separate vitamin B6 group . Moreover, most other large clinical trials have failed to demonstrate that supplemental B vitamins actually reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, even though they lower homocysteine levels. For example, a randomized clinical trial in 5,442 women age 42 or older found no effect of vitamin B6 supplementation (50 mg/day) in combination with 2.5 mg folic acid and 1 mg vitamin B12 on cardiovascular disease risk . Two large randomized controlled trials, the Norwegian Vitamin Trial and the Western Norway B Vitamin Intervention Trial, did include a group that received only vitamin B6 supplements (40 mg/day). The combined analysis of data from these two trials showed no benefit of vitamin B6 supplementation, with or without folic acid (0.8 mg/day) plus vitamin B12 (0.4 mg/day), on major cardiovascular events in 6,837 patients with ischemic heart disease . In a trial of adults who had suffered a nondisabling stroke, supplementation with high or low doses of a combination of vitamins B6 and B12 and folic acid for 2 years had no effect on subsequent stroke incidence, cardiovascular events, or risk of death . The research to date provides little evidence that supplemental amounts of vitamin B6, alone or with folic acid and vitamin B12, can help reduce the risk or severity of cardiovascular disease and stroke. Cancer Some research has associated low plasma vitamin B6 concentrations with an increased risk of certain kinds of cancer . For example, a meta-analysis of prospective studies found that people with a vitamin B6 intake in the highest quintile had a 20% lower risk of colorectal cancer than those with an intake in the lowest quintile . However, the small number of clinical trials completed to date has not shown that vitamin B6 supplementation can help prevent cancer or reduce its impact on mortality. For example, an analysis of data from two large randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in Norway found no association between vitamin B6 supplementation and cancer incidence, mortality, or all-cause mortality . Cognitive function Poor vitamin B6 status has been hypothesized to play a role in the cognitive decline that some older adults experience . Several studies have demonstrated an association between vitamin B6 and brain function in the elderly. For example, an analysis of data from the Boston Normative Aging Study found associations between higher serum vitamin B6 concentrations and better memory test scores in 70 men age 54–81 years . However, a systematic review of 14 randomized controlled trials found insufficient evidence of an effect of vitamin B6 supplementation alone or in combination with vitamin B12 and/or folic acid on cognitive function in people with normal cognitive function, dementia, or ischemic vascular disease . According to this review, most of the studies were of low quality and limited applicability. A Cochrane Review found no evidence that short-term vitamin B6 supplementation (for 5–12 weeks) improves cognitive function or mood in the two studies that the authors evaluated . The review did find some evidence that daily vitamin B6 supplements (20 mg) can affect biochemical indices of vitamin B6 status in healthy older men, but these changes had no overall impact on cognition. More evidence is needed to determine whether vitamin B6 supplements might help prevent or treat cognitive decline in elderly people. Premenstrual syndrome Some evidence suggests that vitamin B6 supplements could reduce the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), but conclusions are limited due to the poor quality of most studies . A meta-analysis of nine published trials involving almost 1,000 women with PMS found that vitamin B6 is more effective in reducing PMS symptoms than placebo, but most of the studies analyzed were small and several had methodological weaknesses . A more recent double-blind, randomized controlled trial in 94 women found that 80 mg pyridoxine taken daily over the course of three cycles was associated with statistically significant reductions in a broad range of PMS symptoms, including moodiness; irritability; forgetfulness; bloating; and, especially, anxiety . The potential effectiveness of vitamin B6 in alleviating the mood-related symptoms of PMS could be due to its role as a cofactor in neurotransmitter biosynthesis . Although vitamin B6 shows promise for alleviating PMS symptoms, more research is needed before drawing firm conclusions. Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy About half of all women experience nausea and vomiting in the first few months of pregnancy, and about 50%–80% experience nausea only . Although this condition is generally known as morning sickness, it often lasts throughout the day. The condition is not life threatening and typically goes away after 12–20 weeks, but its symptoms can disrupt a person's social and physical functioning. Prospective studies on vitamin B6 supplements to treat morning sickness have had mixed results. In two randomized, placebo-controlled trials, 30–75 mg of oral pyridoxine per day significantly decreased nausea in pregnant women who were experiencing nausea . The authors of a recent Cochrane Review of studies on interventions for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy could not draw firm conclusions on the value of vitamin B6 to control the symptoms of morning sickness . Randomized trials have shown that a combination of vitamin B6 and doxylamine (an antihistamine) is associated with a 70% reduction in nausea and vomiting in pregnant women and lower hospitalization rates for this problem . The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) recommends monotherapy with 10–25 mg of vitamin B6 three or four times a day to treat nausea and vomiting in pregnancy . If the patient's condition does not improve, ACOG recommends adding doxylamine. Before taking a vitamin B6 supplement, pregnant women should consult a physician because doses could approach the UL. Health Risks from Excessive Vitamin B6 High intakes of vitamin B6 from food sources have not been reported to cause adverse effects . However, chronic administration of 1–6 g oral pyridoxine per day for 12–40 months can cause severe and progressive sensory neuropathy characterized by ataxia (loss of control of bodily movements) [10,30-33]. Symptom severity appears to be dose dependent, and the symptoms usually stop if the patient discontinues the pyridoxine supplements as soon as the neurologic symptoms appear. Other effects of excessive vitamin B6 intakes include painful, disfiguring dermatological lesions; photosensitivity; and gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea and heartburn . The scientific literature includes isolated case reports of congenital defects in the infants of women who took pyridoxine supplements during the first half of pregnancy . However, a more recent observational study found no association between pyridoxine supplementation (mean dose 132.3 ± 74 mg/day) in pregnant women starting at 7 weeks gestation and continuing for 9 ± 4.2 weeks and teratogenic effects in their infants . The FNB has established ULs for vitamin B6 that apply to both food and supplement intakes (Table 3) . The FNB noted that although several reports show sensory neuropathy occurring at doses lower than 500 mg/day, studies in patients treated with vitamin B6 (average dose of 200 mg/day) for up to 5 years found no evidence of this effect. Based on limitations in the data on potential harms from long-term use, the FNB halved the dose used in these studies to establish a UL of 100 mg/day for adults. ULs are lower for children and adolescents based on body size. The ULs do not apply to individuals receiving vitamin B6 for medical treatment, but such individuals should be under the care of a physician. Table 3: Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for Vitamin B6 Birth to 6 months: Male: Not possible to establish*, Female: Not possible to establish*, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  7–12 months: Male: Not possible to establish*, Female: Not possible to establish*, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  1–3 years: Male: 30 mg, Female: 30 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  4–8 years: Male: 40 mg, Female: 40 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  9–13 years: Male: 60 mg, Female: 60 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  14–18 years: Male: 80 mg, Female: 80 mg, Pregnancy: 80 mg, Lactation: 80 mg 19+ years: Male: 100 mg, Female: 100 mg, Pregnancy: 100 mg, Lactation: 100 mg *Breast milk, formula, and food should be the only sources of vitamin B6 for infants. In 2023, the Panel on Nutrition, Novel Foods and Food Allergens of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) released a scientific opinion on the tolerable upper intake levels for vitamin B6 . Based on systematic reviews that examined associations between vitamin B6 and peripheral neuropathy, the panel set an upper limit for vitamin B6 of 12 mg/day for all adults, including women who are pregnant or lactating, with lower amounts ranging from 2.2 to 10.7 mg/day for infants and children, depending on age. Interactions with Medications Vitamin B6 can interact with certain medications, and several types of medications might adversely affect vitamin B6 levels. A few examples are provided below. Individuals taking these and other medications on a regular basis should discuss their vitamin B6 status with their health care providers. Cycloserine Cycloserine (Seromycin) is a broad-spectrum antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis. In combination with pyridoxal phosphate, cycloserine increases urinary excretion of pyridoxine . The urinary loss of pyridoxine might exacerbate the seizures and neurotoxicity associated with cycloserine. Pyridoxine supplements can help prevent these adverse effects. Antiepileptic medications Some antiepileptic drugs, including valproic acid (Depakene, Stavzor), carbamazepine (Carbatrol, Epitol, Tegretol, and others), and phenytoin (Dilantin) increase the catabolism rate of vitamin B6 vitamers, resulting in low plasma PLP concentrations and hyperhomocysteinemia . High homocysteine levels in antiepileptic drug users might increase the risk of epileptic seizures and systemic vascular events, including stroke, and reduce the ability to control seizures in patients with epilepsy. Furthermore, patients typically use antiepileptic drugs for years, increasing their risk of chronic vascular toxicity. Some research also indicates that pyridoxine supplementation (200 mg/day for 12–120 days) can reduce serum concentrations of phenytoin and phenobarbital, possibly by increasing the drugs' metabolism . Whether lower pyridoxine doses have any effect is not known . Levetiracetam (Keppra) is an antiepileptic medication with behavioral side effects that include irritability, agitation, and depression [39-41]. Preliminary evidence suggests that vitamin B6 supplementation—at such doses as 50–350 mg/day in children [40-42] and 50–100 mg/day in adults —might reduce these side effects. Theophylline Theophylline (Aquaphyllin, Elixophyllin, Theolair, Truxophyllin, and many others) can prevent or treat shortness of breath, wheezing, and other breathing problems caused by asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and other lung diseases. Patients treated with theophylline often have low plasma PLP concentrations, which could contribute to the neurological and central nervous system side effects associated with theophylline, including seizures . Vitamin B6 and Healthful Diets The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\" For more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that Includes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils. Many fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are good sources of vitamin B6. Some ready-to-eat breakfast cereals are fortified with vitamin B6.

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet. Introduction Folate is a water-soluble B vitamin that is naturally present in some foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement. Folate, formerly known as folacin and sometimes vitamin B9, is the generic term for naturally occurring food folates and folates in dietary supplements and fortified foods, including folic acid. Food folates are in the tetrahydrofolate (THF) form and usually have additional glutamate residues, making them polyglutamates . Folic acid is the fully oxidized monoglutamate form of the vitamin that is used in fortified foods and most dietary supplements. Some dietary supplements also contain folate in the monoglutamyl form, 5-MTHF (also known as L-5-MTHF, 5-methyl-folate, L-methylfolate, and methylfolate). Folate functions as a coenzyme or cosubstrate in single-carbon transfers in the synthesis of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and metabolism of amino acids [1-3]. One of the most important folate-dependent reactions is the conversion of homocysteine to methionine in the synthesis of S-adenosyl-methionine, an important methyl donor. Another folate-dependent reaction, the methylation of deoxyuridylate to thymidylate in the formation of DNA, is required for proper cell division. An impairment of this reaction initiates a process that can lead to megaloblastic anemia, one of the hallmarks of folate deficiency . When consumed, food folates are hydrolyzed to the monoglutamate form in the gut prior to absorption by active transport across the intestinal mucosa . Passive diffusion also occurs when pharmacological doses of folic acid are consumed. Before entering the bloodstream, the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase reduces the monoglutamate form to THF and converts it to either methyl or formyl forms . The main form of folate in plasma is 5-MTHF. The activity of dihydrofolate reductase varies greatly among individuals . When the capacity of dihydrofolate reductase is exceeded, unmetabolized folic acid can be present in the blood . Whether unmetabolized folic acid has any biological activity or can be used as a biomarker of folate status is not known . Folate is also synthesized by colonic microbiota and can be absorbed across the colon, although the extent to which colonic folate contributes to folate status is unclear . The total body content of folate is estimated to be 15 to 30 mg; about half of this amount is stored in the liver and the remainder in blood and body tissues . Serum folate concentrations are commonly used to assess folate status; a value above 3 ng/mL indicates adequacy . This indicator, however, is sensitive to recent dietary intake, so it might not reflect long-term status. Erythrocyte folate concentrations provide a longer term measure of folate intakes; a concentration above 140 ng/mL indicates adequate folate status . A combination of serum or erythrocyte folate concentration and indicators of metabolic function can also be used to assess folate status. Plasma homocysteine concentration is a commonly used functional indicator of folate status because homocysteine levels rise when the body cannot convert homocysteine to methionine due to a 5-MTHF deficiency . Homocysteine levels, however, are not a highly specific indicator of folate status because they can be influenced by other factors, including kidney dysfunction and deficiencies of vitamin B12 and other micronutrients . The most commonly used cutoff value for elevated homocysteine levels is 16 micromol/L, although slightly lower values of 12 to 14 micromol/L have also been used . A homocysteine cutoff of 10 micromol/L has been proposed for assessing folate status in populations . Recommended Intakes Intake recommendations for folate and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by an expert committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine . DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following: Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects Table 1 lists the current RDAs for folate as mcg of dietary folate equivalents (DFEs). The FNB developed DFEs to reflect the higher bioavailability of folic acid than that of food folate. At least 85% of folic acid is estimated to be bioavailable when taken with food, whereas only about 50% of folate naturally present in food is bioavailable . Based on these values, the FNB defined DFE as follows: 1 mcg DFE = 1 mcg food folate 1 mcg DFE = 0.6 mcg folic acid from fortified foods or dietary supplements consumed with foods 1 mcg DFE = 0.5 mcg folic acid from dietary supplements taken on an empty stomach 1 mcg DFE = 1 mcg food folate 1 mcg DFE = 0.6 mcg folic acid from fortified foods or dietary supplements consumed with foods 1 mcg DFE = 0.5 mcg folic acid from dietary supplements taken on an empty stomach Factors for converting mcg DFE to mcg for supplemental folate in the form of 5-MTHF have not been formally established . For infants from birth to 12 months, the FNB established an AI for folate that is equivalent to the mean intake of folate in healthy, breastfed infants in the United States (see Table 1). Table 1: Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for Folate Birth to 6 months*: Male: 65 mcg DFE*, Female: 65 mcg DFE*, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  7–12 months*: Male: 80 mcg DFE*, Female: 80 mcg DFE*, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  1–3 years: Male: 150 mcg DFE, Female: 150 mcg DFE, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  4–8 years: Male: 200 mcg DFE, Female: 200 mcg DFE, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  9–13 years: Male: 300 mcg DFE, Female: 300 mcg DFE, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  14–18 years: Male: 400 mcg DFE, Female: 400 mcg DFE, Pregnancy: 600 mcg DFE, Lactation: 500 mcg DFE 19+ years: Male: 400 mcg DFE, Female: 400 mcg DFE, Pregnancy: 600 mcg DFE, Lactation: 500 mcg DFE *Adequate Intake (AI) Sources of Folate Food Folate is naturally present in a wide variety of foods, including vegetables (especially dark green leafy vegetables), fruits and fruit juices, nuts, beans, peas, seafood, eggs, dairy products, meat, poultry, and grains (Table 2) . Spinach, liver, asparagus, and brussels sprouts are among the foods with the highest folate levels. In January 1998, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began requiring manufacturers to add 140 mcg folic acid/100 g to enriched breads, cereals, flours, corn meals, pastas, rice, and other grain products to reduce the risk of neural tube defects (NTDs). Because cereals and grains are widely consumed in the United States, these products have become important contributors of folic acid to the American diet. The fortification program increased mean folic acid intakes in the United States by about 190 mcg/day . In April 2016, FDA approved the voluntary addition of up to 154 mcg folic acid/100 g to corn masa flour . Since November 1, 1998, the Canadian government has also required the addition of 150 mcg folic acid/100 g to many grains, including enriched pasta, corn meal, and white flour . Many other countries, including Costa Rica, Chile, and South Africa, have also established mandatory folic acid fortification programs .

FDA developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for folate is 400 mcg DFE for adults and children age 4 years and older , where mcg DFE = mcg naturally occurring folate + (1.7 x mcg folic acid). The labels must list folate content in mcg DFE per serving and if folic acid is added to the product, they must also list the amount of folic acid in mcg in parentheses. FDA does not require food labels to list folate content unless folic acid has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet. † Fortified with folic acid as part of the folate fortification program. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA's) FoodData Central lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides a comprehensive list of foods containing folate arranged by nutrient content and by food name. Dietary supplements Folic acid is available in multivitamins and prenatal vitamins, supplements containing other B-complex vitamins, and supplements containing only folic acid. Common doses range from 680 to 1,360 mcg DFE (400 to 800 mcg folic acid) in supplements for adults and 340 to 680 mcg DFE (200 to 400 mcg folic acid) in children’s multivitamins . About 85% of supplemental folic acid, when taken with food, is bioavailable . When consumed without food, nearly 100% of supplemental folic acid is bioavailable. Dietary supplements containing 5-MTHF are also available. For some people, supplementation with 5-MTHF might be more beneficial than with folic acid (see People with an MTHFR polymorphism below) . The bioavailability of 5-MTHF in supplements is the same as or greater than that of folic acid [22-27]. However, conversion factors between mcg and mcg DFE for 5-MTHF have not been formally established. FDA allows manufacturers to use either a conversion factor of 1.7 to be comparable to folic acid or their own established conversion factors not to exceed 1.7 . Folate Intakes and Status According to data from the 2013–2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), most people in the United States consume adequate amounts of folate. Mean dietary intakes of folate from foods range from 417 to 547 mcg DFE per day for children age 2–19 . Average daily intakes of folate from food are 602 mcg DFE for males age 20 and older and 455 mcg DFE for females. Although most people consume adequate amounts of folate, certain groups, including women of childbearing age and non-Hispanic black women, are at risk of insufficient folate intakes. Even when intakes of folic acid from dietary supplements are included, 19% of female adolescents age 14 to 18 years and 17% of women age 19 to 30 years do not meet the EAR . Similarly, 23% of non-Hispanic black women have inadequate total intakes, compared with 13% of non-Hispanic white women. About 35% of adults and 28% of children age 1 to 13 years in the United States use supplements containing folic acid . Adults age 51 to 70 years are more likely than members of other age groups to take supplements containing folic acid. Use is also higher among non-Hispanic whites than non-Hispanic blacks or Mexican Americans. People age 2 years and older who take supplements containing folic acid get a mean of 712 mcg DFE from those supplements . Measurements of erythrocyte folate levels also suggest that most people in the United States have adequate folate status. According to an analysis of NHANES 2003–2006 data, less than 0.5% of children age 1 to 18 years have deficient erythrocyte folate concentrations . Mean concentrations in this age group range from 211 to 294 ng/mL depending on age, dietary habits, and supplement use. In adults, mean erythrocyte folate concentrations range from 216 to 398 ng/mL, also indicating adequate folate status . Some population groups are at risk of obtaining excessive folic acid. About 5% of men and women age 51–70 and men age 71 and older have folic acid intakes exceeding the UL of 1,000 mcg per day, primarily because of the folic acid they obtain from dietary supplements . Furthermore, 30% to 66% of children age 1 to 13 years who take folic acid-containing supplements have intakes of folic acid from both fortified food and dietary supplements exceeding the UL of 300–600 mcg per day . Almost all children age 1 to 8 years who consume at least 200 mcg/day folic acid from dietary supplements have total intakes that exceed the UL . Little is known about the long-term effects of high folic acid doses in children . Folate Deficiency Isolated folate deficiency is uncommon; folate deficiency usually coexists with other nutrient deficiencies because of its strong association with poor diet, alcoholism, and malabsorptive disorders . Megaloblastic anemia, which is characterized by large, abnormally nucleated erythrocytes, is the primary clinical sign of folate or vitamin B12 deficiency . Its symptoms include weakness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, irritability, headache, heart palpitations, and shortness of breath . Folate deficiency can also produce soreness in and shallow ulcerations on the tongue and oral mucosa; changes in skin, hair, or fingernail pigmentation; gastrointestinal symptoms; and elevated blood concentrations of homocysteine . Women with insufficient folate intakes are at increased risk of giving birth to infants with NTDs . Inadequate maternal folate status has also been associated with low infant birth weight, preterm delivery, and fetal growth retardation . Groups at Risk of Folate Inadequacy Frank folate deficiency is rare in the United States, but some individuals might have marginal folate status. The following groups are among those most likely to be at risk of folate inadequacy. People with alcohol use disorder People with alcohol use disorder frequently have poor-quality diets that contain insufficient amounts of folate. Moreover, alcohol interferes with folate absorption and hepatic uptake, accelerates folate breakdown, and increases its renal excretion . An evaluation in Portugal, where the food supply is not fortified with folic acid, found low folate status in more than 60% of people with chronic alcoholism . Even moderate alcohol consumption of 240 ml (8 fluid ounces) red wine per day or 80 ml (2.7 fluid ounces) vodka per day for 2 weeks can significantly decrease serum folate concentrations in healthy men, although not to levels below the cutoff for folate adequacy of 3 ng/ml . Women of childbearing age All women and adolescents who are capable of becoming pregnant should obtain adequate amounts of folate to reduce the risk of NTDs and other birth defects . However, some women of childbearing age get insufficient amounts of folate even if they take dietary supplements . Women of childbearing age should obtain 400 mcg/day folic acid from dietary supplements and/or fortified foods in addition to the folate provided by a varied diet . Pregnant women During pregnancy, demands for folate increase because of its role in nucleic acid synthesis . To meet this need, the FNB increased the folate RDA from 400 mcg DFE/day for nonpregnant women to 600 mcg DFE/day during pregnancy . This level of intake might be difficult for some women to achieve through diet alone. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends a prenatal vitamin supplement for most pregnant women to ensure that they obtain adequate amounts of folic acid and other nutrients . People with malabsorptive disorders Several medical conditions increase the risk of folate deficiency. People with malabsorptive disorders—including tropical sprue, celiac disease, and inflammatory bowel disease—might absorb less folate than people without these disorders ; for example, about 20%–60% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease have folate deficiency . Diminished gastric acid secretion associated with atrophic gastritis, gastric surgery, and other conditions can also reduce folate absorption . People with an MTHFR polymorphism People with a genetic polymorphism, 677C>T, in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene have a reduced ability to convert folate to one of its active forms, 5-MTHF, because the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase enzyme needed for this conversion is less active . About 25% of Hispanics, 10% of Caucasians and Asians, and 1% of African Americans are homozygous for the 677C>T MTHFR polymorphism . This polymorphism results in less biologically available 5-MTHF and, thus, reduced methylation potential, leading to elevated homocysteine levels and an increased risk of NTDs . Although the research on the benefits of folate supplementation for people with this genetic polymorphism is inconclusive, some of these people might benefit from supplementation with 5-MTHF . However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends 400 mcg/day of folic acid, not 5-MTHF, for people who could become pregnant, even if they have a 677C>T MTHFR polymorphism (see Neural tube defects below) . Folate and Health This section focuses on seven diseases and disorders in which folate might play a role: autism spectrum disorder; cancer; cardiovascular disease and stroke; dementia, cognitive function, and Alzheimer’s disease; depression; NTDs; and preterm birth, congenital heart defects, and other congenital anomalies. Autism spectrum disorder Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulty communicating and interacting with other people, limited interests, and repetitive behaviors. The classification and diagnosis of ASD was changed in 2013 to include conditions previously known as autistic disorder, Asperger’s syndrome, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified . The causes of ASD are not clear, but genetic and environmental factors (including infections) and prenatal exposure to certain drugs, pollutants, and pesticides are believed to play a role [43-46]. Emerging evidence suggests that periconceptional folic acid supplementation might reduce the risk of ASD or mitigate the potentially increased risk of ASD from prenatal exposure to certain drugs and toxic chemicals. The mechanism of these potential benefits is unknown, but it might be related to folic acid’s role in DNA methylation, which, in turn, can affect neurodevelopment [47-49]. Some, but not all, observational studies have shown associations between maternal use of folic acid and/or multivitamin supplements before and/or during pregnancy and lower risk of ASD in the women’s offspring. For example, the prospective Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study that included 85,176 children age 3.3 to 10.2 years found that children of mothers who took up to 400 mcg per day folic acid during all or part of the time from 4 weeks before to 8 weeks after the start of pregnancy were 39% less likely to have autistic disorder than those whose mothers did not take the supplements . The results showed no significant associations, however, between supplementation and Asperger’s syndrome or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. In a U.S. population-based, case-control study of 837 children, those born to mothers who consumed a mean of 600 mcg folic acid per day or more from supplements and fortified breakfast cereals during the first month of pregnancy had a 38% lower risk of ASD than those of mothers who consumed less than 600 mcg per day . This association was strongest for mothers and children with the 677C>T MTHFR polymorphism. Similarly, a 2018 case-control cohort study of 45,300 Israeli children demonstrated a significantly decreased risk of ASD in children of mothers who took folic acid and/or multivitamin supplements before and/or during pregnancy . Conversely, a longitudinal, population-based cohort of 35,059 pregnant Danish women and their children found no association between periconceptional folic acid or multivitamin use and ASD . Periconceptional use of folic acid might mitigate the potentially increased risk of ASD in children exposed to certain drugs and neurotoxins in utero [44-46]. An analysis of data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, which included 104,946 children, found that children exposed to antiepileptic drugs (known to reduce folate in vivo) in utero were 5.9 to 7.9 times more likely to have autistic traits at age 18 and 36 months if their mothers did not take folic acid periconceptionally than if they did . In addition, the severity of autistic traits was inversely associated with both maternal plasma folate concentrations and folic acid doses. Similarly, in a U.S. study of 712 children, mothers exposed to any indoor pesticide during pregnancy who had folic acid intakes of 800 mcg or more per day during the first month of pregnancy were 1.7 times more likely to have a child with ASD than women with the same folic acid intakes who were not exposed to indoor pesticides . The risk of ASD was even higher (2.5 times) if the women were exposed to indoor pesticides and had daily folic acid intakes of less than 800 mcg, suggesting that folic acid might attenuate the potentially increased risk of ASD from pesticide exposure. Overall, the evidence to date suggests a possible inverse association between mothers’ periconceptional folic acid intakes and risk of ASD in their offspring. However, most, if not all, of the currently available data are observational, and confounding weakens the ability to demonstrate causal inference. Additional research and validation in other studies are needed before firm conclusions can be drawn. Cancer Several epidemiological studies have suggested an inverse association between folate intakes and status and the risk of colorectal, lung, pancreatic, esophageal, stomach, cervical, ovarian, breast, bladder, and other cancers . Research has not established the precise nature of folate’s effect on carcinogenesis, but scientists hypothesize that folate might influence cancer development through its role in one-carbon metabolism and subsequent effects on DNA replication and cell division . Evidence also indicates that folate might play a dual role in cancer initiation and progression . That is, folate might suppress some types of cancer during the early stages of development, whereas high doses of folic acid taken after preneoplastic lesions have been established might promote cancer development and progression. Results from clinical trials involving folic acid supplementation have been mixed. In addition, most trials have included other B-vitamins (frequently at doses well above RDA levels) and sometimes other nutrients, making it difficult to disentangle the effects, if any, of folic acid alone. For example, in a trial in France, 2,501 people with a history of cardiovascular disease received daily supplements of 560 mcg folic acid, 3 mg vitamin B6, and 20 mcg vitamin B12 for 5 years . The researchers found no association between B-vitamin supplementation and cancer outcomes. In a combined analysis of two trials in Norway (where foods are not fortified with folic acid), supplementation with 800 mcg/day folic acid plus 400 mcg/day vitamin B12 for a median of 39 months in 3,411 people with ischemic heart disease increased cancer incidence rates by 21% and cancer mortality rates by 38% compared with no supplementation . Findings from these Norwegian trials have raised concerns about folic acid supplementation’s potential to raise cancer risk. The most thorough research has focused on folate’s effect on the development of colorectal cancer and its precursor, adenoma . Several epidemiological studies have found inverse associations between high dietary folate intakes and the risk of colorectal adenoma and cancer [61-64]. For example, in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, a cohort study of more than 525,000 people age 50 to 71 years in the United States, individuals with total folate intakes of 900 mcg/day or higher had a 30% lower risk of colorectal cancer than those with intakes lower than 200 mcg/day . Other studies, however, have found no significant associations between dietary folate intakes or circulating folate concentrations and colorectal cancer risk. Several clinical trials have examined whether supplemental folic acid (sometimes in combination with other B-vitamins) reduces the risk of colorectal adenoma in individuals with or without a history of adenoma. In the Women’s Antioxidant and Folic Acid Cardiovascular Study, which included 1,470 older women at high risk of cardiovascular disease, daily supplementation with 2,500 mcg folic acid, 50 mg vitamin B6, and 1,000 mcg vitamin B12 did not affect rates of colorectal adenoma during 7.3 years of intervention and about 2 years of postintervention follow-up . A pooled analysis of three large clinical trials (one in Canada, one in both the United States and Canada, and one in both the United Kingdom and Denmark) found that folic acid supplementation for up to 3.5 years neither increased nor decreased adenoma recurrence rates in people with a history of adenoma . However, in one of the studies included in the analysis, folic acid supplementation (1,000 mcg/day) significantly increased the risks of having three or more adenomas and of noncolorectal cancers, although it had no effect on colorectal cancer risk . Folic acid supplementation also had no effect on the risk of all cancer types combined in the pooled analysis of three clinical trials cited above . Similarly, a meta-analysis of 13 randomized trials showed no statistically significant effects of folic acid supplementation (median daily dose of 2,000 mcg) over an average treatment period of 5.2 years on overall cancer incidence or the incidence of colorectal, lung, breast, prostate, or other cancers . Some research has found associations between folic acid supplementation and increased cancer risk. In a randomized clinical trial investigating osteoporotic fracture incidence in 2,919 participants age 65 years or older with elevated homocysteine levels, those who received 400 mcg folic acid plus 500 mcg vitamin B12 and 600 International Units (IU) vitamin D3 for 2 years reported a significantly higher cancer incidence, especially of colorectal and other gastrointestinal cancers, than those who received only 600 IU vitamin D3 . In addition, a 2018 prospective study found that folic acid intake from fortified foods and supplements was positively associated with a risk of cancer recurrence among 619 patients with non–muscle-invasive bladder cancer, whereas natural folate intakes showed no significant association . Higher plasma folate concentrations have also been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation . A secondary analysis of the study by Cole and colleagues found that folic acid supplementation significantly increased the risk of prostate cancer . Subsequent research has shown an association between increased cancer cell proliferation and higher serum folate concentrations in men with prostate cancer . A meta-analysis of six randomized controlled trials that included a total of 25,738 men found that the risk of prostate cancer was 24% higher in men receiving folic acid supplements than those taking a placebo . The mixed findings from clinical trials, combined with evidence from laboratory and animal studies indicating that high folate status promotes tumor progression, suggest that folate might play dual roles in cancer risk, depending on the dosage and timing of the exposure. Modest doses of folic acid taken before preneoplastic lesions are established might suppress cancer development in healthy tissues, whereas high doses taken after the establishment of preneoplastic lesions might promote cancer development and progression [9,60,79-82]. This hypothesis is supported by a 2011 prospective study that found an inverse association between folate intake and risk of colorectal cancer only during early preadenoma stages . A 2015 expert panel convened by the National Toxicology Program and the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements concluded that folic acid supplements do not reduce cancer risk in people with adequate baseline folate status. The panel also determined that the consistent findings from human studies that supplemental folic acid has an adverse effect on cancer growth justify additional research on the effects of folic acid supplementation on cancer risk . Several important questions about these effects remain, including the dose and timing of folic acid supplementation that might exert tumor-promoting effects and whether this effect is specific to synthetic folic acid or other forms of folate . Overall, the evidence to date indicates that adequate dietary folate intake might reduce the risk of some forms of cancer. However, the effects of supplemental folic acid on cancer risk are unclear, especially among individuals with a history of colorectal adenomas or other forms of cancer. More research is needed to fully understand how dietary folate and supplemental folic acid affect cancer risk and whether their effects differ by timing of exposure. Cardiovascular disease and stroke An elevated homocysteine level has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease . Folate and other B vitamins are involved in homocysteine metabolism, and researchers have hypothesized that these micronutrients reduce cardiovascular disease risk by lowering homocysteine levels . Folic acid (and vitamin B12) supplements lower homocysteine levels. However, these supplements do not actually decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease, although they appear to provide protection from stroke [85-94]. For example, in 5,442 U.S. women age 42 or older who were at high risk of cardiovascular disease, daily supplements containing 2,500 mcg folic acid, 1 mg vitamin B12, and 50 mg vitamin B6 for 7.3 years did not reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events . In a substudy of 300 participants, the supplementation also had no significant effects on biomarkers of vascular inflammation , but it did lower homocysteine levels by a mean of 18.5% . Another clinical trial included 5,522 patients age 55 years or older with vascular disease or diabetes from various countries (including the United States and Canada) that had a folic acid fortification program and some that did not . Patients received 2,500 mcg folic acid plus 50 mg vitamin B6 and 1 mg vitamin B12 or placebo for an average of 5 years. Compared with placebo, treatment with B vitamins significantly decreased homocysteine levels but did not reduce the risk of death from cardiovascular causes or myocardial infarction. Supplementation did, however, significantly reduce the risk of stroke by 25%. In a large trial in regions of China without folic acid fortification among 20,702 adults with hypertension but no history of stroke or myocardial infarction, supplementation with 800 mcg folic acid plus 10 mg enalapril (used to treat high blood pressure) for a median of 4.5 years significantly reduced the risk of stroke by 21% compared with enalapril alone . The effect was more pronounced in participants with the lowest baseline levels of plasma folate. An analysis of 10,789 participants from this trial found that folic acid supplementation significantly reduced the risk of stroke by 73% among those who had a low platelet count and an elevated homocysteine level (increasing their risk of stroke) but had no significant effect on participants with a high platelet count and low homocysteine level . These findings suggest that folic acid supplementation might primarily benefit those with insufficient folate levels, which are less common in countries, such as the United States, with folic acid fortification . The authors of a 2012 meta-analysis of 19 randomized controlled trials that included 47,921 participants concluded that B-vitamin supplementation has no effect on the risk of cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, or cardiovascular death, although it does reduce the risk of stroke by 12% . Likewise, the authors of the third update of a Cochrane Review of the effects of homocysteine-lowering interventions on cardiovascular events concluded that folic acid supplementation alone or in combination with vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 does not affect the risk of myocardial infarction or death from any cause, but it does reduce the risk of stroke . Three other meta-analyses have also found that folic acid is effective for preventing stroke, especially in populations exposed to no or partial folic acid fortification . Overall, the available evidence suggests that supplementation with folic acid alone or in combination with other B-vitamins reduces the risk of stroke, especially in populations with low folate status, but does not affect other cardiovascular endpoints. Dementia, cognitive function, and Alzheimer’s disease Most observational studies conducted to date have shown positive associations between elevated homocysteine levels and the incidence of both Alzheimer’s disease and dementia [32,79,100-104]. Scientists hypothesize that elevated homocysteine levels might have a negative effect on the brain via numerous mechanisms, including cerebrovascular ischemia leading to neuronal cell death, activation of tau kinases leading to tangle deposition, and inhibition of methylation reactions . Some, but not all, observational studies have also found correlations between low serum folate concentrations and both poor cognitive function and higher risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease . Despite this evidence, most clinical trial research has not shown that folic acid supplementation affects cognitive function or the development of dementia or Alzheimer’s disease, even though supplementation lowers homocysteine levels. In one randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in the Netherlands, 195 people age 70 years or older with no or moderate cognitive impairment received 400 mcg folic acid plus 1 mg vitamin B12; 1 mg vitamin B12; or placebo for 24 weeks . Treatment with folic acid plus vitamin B12 reduced homocysteine concentrations by 36% but did not improve cognitive function. In another clinical trial in older adults (mean age 74.1 years) with elevated homocysteine levels, supplementation with 400 mcg folic acid plus 500 mcg vitamin B12 and 600 IU vitamin D3 for 2 years lowered homocysteine levels but did not affect cognitive performance compared with 600 IU vitamin D3 alone . As part of the Women’s Antioxidant and Folic Acid Cardiovascular Study, 2,009 U.S. women age 65 years or older at high risk of cardiovascular disease were randomly assigned to receive daily supplements containing 2,500 mcg folic acid plus 1 mg vitamin B12 and 50 mg vitamin B6 or placebo . After an average of 1.2 years, B-vitamin supplementation did not affect mean cognitive change from baseline compared with placebo. However, in a subset of women with a low baseline dietary intake of B vitamins, supplementation significantly slowed the rate of cognitive decline. In a trial that included 340 individuals in the United States with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease, daily supplements of 5,000 mcg folic acid plus 1 mg vitamin B12 and 25 mg vitamin B6 for 18 months did not slow cognitive decline compared with placebo . A secondary analysis of a study in Australia (which did not have mandatory folic acid fortification at the time of the study) found that daily supplementation with 400 mcg folic acid plus 100 mcg vitamin B12 for 2 years improved some measures of cognitive function, particularly memory, in 900 adults age 60 to 74 years who had depressive symptoms . Another meta-analysis included 11 randomized controlled trials in more than 20,000 older adults (mean age 60–82 years) that administered 400 to 2,500 mcg folic acid plus 20–1,000 mcg vitamin B12 in 10 trials and 3–50 mg vitamin B6 in 8 trials for 0.3 to 7.1 years. The supplementation significantly lowered homocysteine levels but did not affect cognitive aging, global cognitive function, or specific cognitive domains (including memory, speed, and executive function) . Several large reviews have evaluated the effect of B vitamins on cognitive function. Most of the authors concluded that supplementation with folic acid alone or in combination with vitamins B12 or B6 does not appear to improve cognitive function in individuals with or without cognitive impairment [112-115]. Some noted, however, that when researchers took baseline homocysteine and B-vitamin status into account, B-vitamin supplementation slowed cognitive decline in individuals at high risk of cognitive decline . For example, one trial in the Netherlands administered either 800 mcg folic acid or placebo daily for 3 years to 818 participants age 50–70 years with elevated homocysteine levels (13 micromol/L or higher) and normal vitamin B12 levels . Folic acid supplementation reduced homocysteine concentrations by 26% and significantly improved global cognitive function, memory, and information processing speed compared with placebo, but it did not affect sensorimotor speed, complex speed, or word fluency. Additional clinical trials are needed to better understand the effects of folic acid supplementation on cognitive function and cognitive decline. Depression Low folate status has been linked to depression and poor response to antidepressants in some, but not all, studies. The possible mechanisms are unclear but might be related to folate’s role in methylation reactions in the brain, neurotransmitter synthesis, and homocysteine metabolism . However, secondary factors linked to depression, such as unhealthy eating patterns and alcohol use disorder, might also contribute to the observed association between low folate status and depression [119. In an ethnically diverse population study of 2,948 people age 15 to 39 years in the United States, serum and erythrocyte folate concentrations were significantly lower in individuals with major depression than in those who had never been depressed . An analysis of 2005–2006 NHANES data found that higher serum concentrations of folate were associated with a lower prevalence of depression in 2,791 adults age 20 or older . The association was statistically significant in females, but not in males. However, another analysis showed no associations between folate intakes from both food and dietary supplements and depression among 1,368 healthy Canadians age 67–84 years . Results from a study of 52 men and women with major depressive disorder showed that only 1 of 14 participants with low serum folate levels responded to antidepressant treatment compared with 17 of 38 with normal folate levels . A few studies have examined whether folate status affects the risk of depression during pregnancy or after childbirth. A systematic review of these studies had mixed results . One study included in the review among 709 women in Singapore found that compared with women with higher plasma folate concentrations (mean 40.4 nmol/L [17.8 ng/mL]) at 26–28 weeks’ gestation, those with lower plasma folate concentrations (mean 27.3 nmol/L [12.0 ng/mL]) had a significantly higher risk of depression during pregnancy but not after giving birth . Another study of 2,856 women in the United Kingdom found no significant associations between red blood cell folate levels or folate intakes from food and dietary supplements before or during pregnancy and postpartum depressive symptoms . More recently, a cohort study of 1,592 Chinese women found a lower prevalence of postpartum depression in women who took folic acid supplements for more than 6 months during pregnancy than in those who took them for less time . Studies have had mixed results on whether folic acid supplementation might be a helpful adjuvant treatment for depression when used with traditional antidepressant medications. In a clinical trial in the United Kingdom, 127 patients with major depression were randomly assigned to receive either 500 mcg folic acid or placebo in addition to 20 mg of fluoxetine daily for 10 weeks . Although the effects in men were not statistically significant, women who received fluoxetine plus folic acid had a significantly greater improvement in depressive symptoms than those who received fluoxetine plus placebo. Another clinical trial in the United Kingdom randomized 475 adults with moderate to severe depression who were taking antidepressant medications to either 5,000 mcg folic acid or placebo daily for 12 weeks in addition to their antidepressants . Measures of depression did not improve in participants taking folic acid compared with those taking placebo. The authors of a systematic review and meta-analysis of four trials of folic acid (<5,000 mcg/day in two trials; 5,000 mcg/day in two trials) in combination with fluoxetine or other antidepressants in patients with major depressive disorder concluded that less than 5,000 mcg/day folic acid might be beneficial as an adjunct to serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) therapy . The authors noted, however, that this conclusion was based on low-quality evidence. Another meta-analysis of four clinical trials found that 500–10,000 mcg folic acid per day for 6–12 weeks as an adjunctive treatment did not significantly affect measures of depression compared with placebo . Other studies have examined the effects of 5-MTHF supplementation as an adjuvant treatment to antidepressants, and results suggest that it might have more promise than folic acid [127-130]. In a clinical trial in 148 adults with major depressive disorder, supplementation with 7,500 mcg/day 5-MTHF for 30 days followed by 15,000 mcg/day for another 30 days, both in conjunction with SSRI treatment, did not improve measures of depression compared with SSRI treatment plus placebo . However, in a subsequent trial with the same study design in 75 adults, supplementation with 15,000 mcg/day 5-MTHF plus SSRI treatment for the full 60 days did significantly improve depression compared with SSRI treatment plus placebo . The authors of a systematic review and meta-analysis of three trials of 5-MTHF (<15,000 mcg/day in one trial, and 15,000 mcg/day in two trials) in combination with fluoxetine or other antidepressants, concluded that 15,000 mcg/day 5-MTHF might be an effective adjunct to SSRI therapy in patients with major depressive disorder, although they noted that this conclusion was based on low-quality evidence . In addition, evidence-based guidelines from the British Association for Psychopharmacology and the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments state that 5-MTHF might be effective as an adjunct to SSRI treatment for depressive disorders. Additional research is needed to fully understand the association between folate status and depression. Although limited evidence suggests that supplementation with certain forms and doses of folate might be a helpful adjuvant treatment for depressive disorders, more research is needed to confirm these findings. In addition, many of the doses of folate used in studies of depression exceed the UL and should be taken only under medical supervision. Neural tube defects NTDs result in malformations of the spine (spina bifida), skull, and brain (anencephaly). They are the most common major congenital malformations of the central nervous system and result from a failure of the neural tube to close at either the upper or lower end on days 21 to 28 after conception . The prevalence rate of spina bifida and anencephaly (the two most common types of NTDs) in the United States is 5.5 to 6.5 per 10,000 births . Because of its role in the synthesis of DNA and other critical cell components, folate is especially important during phases of rapid cell growth . Although the mechanism has not been fully established, clinical trial evidence shows that adequate periconceptional folic acid consumption by women prevents a substantial proportion of NTDs . Since 1998, when mandatory folic acid fortification began in the United States, NTD rates have declined by 28% . However, significant racial and ethnic disparities persist. NTD prevalence rates are highest among Hispanic women and lowest among non-Hispanic black women. Factors that might contribute to these disparities include differences in dietary and supplement-taking practices as well as factors other than folate status—such as maternal diabetes, obesity, and intake of other nutrients (e.g., vitamin B12)—which are also believed to affect the risk of NTDs [132,137,139-141]. In addition, women with the 677C>T MTHFR polymorphism—which is more common in Hispanics than Caucasians, Asians, and African Americans—might have an increased risk of NTDs . Another consideration is the fact that the data on NTD prevalence rates were collected before 2016, when FDA approved the voluntary addition of folic acid to corn masa flour , an ingredient commonly consumed by Hispanic populations. Whether this policy change has affected the disparities in NTD rates between Hispanic women and other populations is not yet known. Because approximately 50% of pregnancies in the United States are unplanned, adequate folate status is especially important during the periconceptional period before a woman might be aware that she is pregnant. The FNB advises all women and adolescents who are capable of becoming pregnant to “consume 400 mcg of folic acid daily from supplements, fortified foods, or both in addition to consuming food folate from a varied diet” . The U.S. Public Health Service and CDC have published similar recommendations . Consuming 400 mcg/day folic acid helps prevent NTDs, even in women with the 677C>T MTHFR polymorphism . The authors of a 2017 systematic review concluded that folic acid supplementation protected users from NTDs in studies conducted before food fortification with folic acid began in the United States . Although studies conducted since that time do not demonstrate a clear protective association (possibly because of food fortification effects, study design flaws, or inadequate sample sizes) , the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that all women and adolescents who are planning to become or capable of becoming pregnant take a daily supplement containing 400 to 800 mcg folic acid starting least 1 month before conception and continuing through the first 2 to 3 months of pregnancy . The FNB has not issued recommendations for women who have given birth to a child with an NTD and plan to become pregnant again. However, other experts recommend that these women obtain 4,000 to 5,000 mcg supplemental folic acid daily starting at least 1 to 3 months before conception and continuing for 2½ to 3 months after conception . These doses exceed the UL and should be taken only under medical supervision . Preterm birth, congenital heart defects, and other congenital anomalies According to observational studies, folic acid supplementation might increase mean gestational age and lower the risk of preterm birth . In addition, folic acid in combination with a multivitamin supplement helps minimize the risk of congenital heart defects, possibly because cardiac tissue development depends on cells that require large amounts of folate . The authors of a large population-based cohort study of about 98% of all births in Canada from 1990 to 2011 concluded that folic acid fortification of foods was associated with an 11% reduction in the rate of nonchromosomal congenital heart defects . In a population-based case-control study in Atlanta involving 3,987 infants, congenital heart defects were 24% less common in the infants of women who took multivitamins containing folic acid during the periconceptional period than in the infants of women who did not . A case-control study in California in 866 infants had similar results . However, it is not possible to determine whether the findings from these studies could be attributed to components of multivitamins other than folic acid. Studies have also found associations between the use of folic acid in combination with multivitamin supplements and reduced occurrence at birth of urinary tract anomalies, oral facial clefts, limb defects, and hydrocephalus, but the results of these studies have been inconsistent . Additional research is needed to fully understand the extent to which maternal consumption of folic acid might affect the risk of these adverse birth outcomes. However, folic acid’s established role in preventing NTDs—and possibly other birth defects—underscores its importance during the periconceptional period. Health Risks from Excessive Folate Large amounts of folate can correct the megaloblastic anemia, but not the neurological damage, that can result from vitamin B12 deficiency. Some experts have therefore been concerned that high intakes of folate supplements might mask vitamin B12 deficiency until its neurological consequences become irreversible. Questions about this possibility still remain, but the focus of concern has shifted to the potential for large amounts of folate to precipitate or exacerbate the anemia and cognitive symptoms associated with vitamin B12 deficiency [2,85,148-153]. Concerns have also been raised that high folic acid intakes might accelerate the progression of preneoplastic lesions, increasing the risk of colorectal and possibly other cancers in certain individuals . In addition, intakes of 1,000 mcg per day or more of folic acid from supplements during the periconception period have been associated with lower scores on several tests of cognitive development in children at age 4–5 years than in children of mothers who took 400 mcg to 999 mcg . Intakes of folic acid that exceed the body’s ability to reduce it to THF lead to unmetabolized folic acid in the body, which has been linked to reduced numbers and activity of natural killer cells, suggesting that it could affect the immune system . In addition, some scientists have hypothesized that unmetabolized folic acid might be related to cognitive impairment among older adults . These potential negative health consequences are not well understood and warrant further research . Studies have found unmetabolized folic acid in blood from children, adolescents, and adults ; breastmilk ; and cord blood from newborns . Limited research suggests that single doses of 300 mcg or 400 mcg folic acid (a common amount in folic acid-containing supplements or servings of fortified foods, such as breakfast cereals) result in detectable serum levels of unmetabolized folic acid, whereas doses of 100 mcg or 200 mcg do not . In addition, a dose-frequency interaction appears to occur in which smaller amounts of folic acid consumed more frequently produce higher unmetabolized folic acid concentrations than the same total dose consumed in larger, less frequent amounts . Based on the metabolic interactions between folate and vitamin B12, the FNB established a UL for the synthetic forms of folate available in dietary supplements and fortified foods (Table 3) . The FNB did not establish a UL for folate from food because high intakes of folate from food sources have not been reported to cause adverse effects . Thus, unlike the RDAs, the ULs are in mcg, not mcg DFE. For folic acid, 1,000 mcg is equivalent to 1,667 mcg DFE because 0.6 mcg folic acid = 1 mcg DFE . The ULs do not apply to individuals taking high doses of supplemental folate under medical supervision . Table 3: Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for Folate from Supplements or Fortified Foods Birth to 6 months: Male: Not possible to establish*, Female: Not possible to establish*, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  7–12 months: Male: Not possible to establish*, Female: Not possible to establish*, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  1–3 years: Male: 300 mcg, Female: 300 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  4–8 years: Male: 400 mcg, Female: 400 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  9–13 years: Male: 600 mcg, Female: 600 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  14–18 years: Male: 800 mcg, Female: 800 mcg, Pregnancy: 800 mcg, Lactation: 800 mcg 19+ years: Male: 1,000 mcg, Female: 1,000 mcg, Pregnancy: 1,000 mcg, Lactation: 1,000 mcg * Breast milk, formula, and food should be the only sources of folate for infants. Interactions with Medications Folate supplements can interact with several medications. A few examples are provided below. Individuals taking these medications on a regular basis should discuss their folate intakes with their health care providers. Methotrexate Methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall), used to treat cancer and autoimmune diseases, is a folate antagonist. Patients taking methotrexate for cancer should consult their oncologist before taking folate supplements because the supplements could interfere with methotrexate’s anticancer effects . However, folate supplements might reduce the gastrointestinal side effects of low-dose methotrexate taken for rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis . Antiepileptic medications Antiepileptic medications, such as phenytoin (Dilantin), carbamazepine (Carbatrol, Tegretol, Equetro, Epitol), and valproate (Depacon), are used to treat epilepsy, psychiatric diseases, and other medical conditions. These medications can reduce serum folate levels . Furthermore, folate supplements might reduce serum levels of these medications, so patients taking antiepileptic drugs should check with their health care provider before taking folate supplements . Sulfasalazine Sulfasalazine (Azulfidine) is used primarily to treat ulcerative colitis. It inhibits the intestinal absorption of folate and can cause folate deficiency . Patients taking sulfasalazine should ask their health care provider whether they should increase their dietary folate intake, start taking a folate supplement, or both . Folate and Healthful Diets The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\" For more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that Includes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils. Many fruits and vegetables are good sources of folate. In the United States, bread, cereal, flour, cornmeal, pasta, rice, and other grain products are fortified with folic acid. Includes a variety of protein foods such as lean meats; poultry; eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; nuts and seeds; and soy products. Beef liver contains high amounts of folate.

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet. Introduction Potassium, the most abundant intracellular cation, is an essential nutrient that is naturally present in many foods and available as a dietary supplement. Potassium is present in all body tissues and is required for normal cell function because of its role in maintaining intracellular fluid volume and transmembrane electrochemical gradients . Potassium has a strong relationship with sodium, the main regulator of extracellular fluid volume, including plasma volume. The total amount of potassium in the adult body is about 45 millimole (mmol)/kg body weight (about 140 g for a 175 pound adult; 1 mmol = 1 milliequivalent [mEq] or 39.1 mg potassium) . Most potassium resides intracellularly, and a small amount is in extracellular fluid [2-4]. The intracellular concentration of potassium is about 30 times higher than the extracellular concentration, and this difference forms a transmembrane electrochemical gradient that is maintained via the sodium-potassium (Na+/K+) ATPase transporter . In addition to maintaining cellular tonicity, this gradient is required for proper nerve transmission, muscle contraction, and kidney function. Potassium is absorbed via passive diffusion, primarily in the small intestine . About 90% of ingested potassium is absorbed and used to maintain its normal intracellular and extracellular concentrations . Potassium is excreted primarily in the urine, some is excreted in the stool, and a very small amount is lost in sweat. The kidneys control potassium excretion in response to changes in dietary intakes, and potassium excretion increases rapidly in healthy people after potassium consumption, unless body stores are depleted . The kidneys can adapt to variable potassium intakes in healthy individuals, but a minimum of 5 mmol (about 195 mg) potassium is excreted daily in urine . This, combined with other obligatory losses, suggests that potassium balance cannot be achieved with intakes less than about 400–800 mg/day. Normal serum concentrations of potassium range from about 3.6 to 5.0 mmol/L and are regulated by a variety of mechanisms . Diarrhea, vomiting, kidney disease, use of certain medications, and other conditions that alter potassium excretion or cause transcellular potassium shifts can cause hypokalemia (serum levels below 3.6 mmol/L) or hyperkalemia (serum levels above 5.0 mmol/L) . Otherwise, in healthy individuals with normal kidney function, abnormally low or high blood levels of potassium are rare. Assessing potassium status is not routinely done in clinical practice, and it is difficult to do because most potassium in the body is inside cells. Although blood potassium levels can provide some indication of potassium status, they often correlate poorly with tissue potassium stores . Other methods to measure potassium status include collecting balance data (measuring net potassium retention and loss); measuring the total amount of potassium or the total amount of exchangeable potassium in the body; and conducting tissue analyses (e.g., muscle biopsies), but all have limitations . Recommended Intakes Intake recommendations for potassium and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by expert committees of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) . DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following: Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects In 2019, a NASEM committee updated the DRIs for potassium (and sodium) . The committee found the data insufficient to derive an EAR for potassium. Therefore, they established AIs for all ages based on the highest median potassium intakes in healthy children and adults and on estimates of potassium intakes from breast milk and complementary foods in infants. Table 1 lists the current AIs for potassium for healthy individuals. Table 1: Adequate Intakes (AIs) for Potassium* Birth to 6 months: Male: 400 mg, Female: 400 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  7–12 months: Male: 860 mg, Female: 860 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  1–3 years: Male: 2,000 mg, Female: 2,000 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  4–8 years: Male: 2,300 mg, Female: 2,300 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  9–13 years: Male: 2,500 mg, Female: 2,300 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  14–18 years: Male: 3,000 mg, Female: 2,300 mg, Pregnancy: 2,600 mg, Lactation: 2,500 mg 19–50 years: Male: 3,400 mg, Female: 2,600 mg, Pregnancy: 2,900 mg, Lactation: 2,800 mg 51+ years: Male: 3,400 mg, Female: 2,600 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  *The AIs do not apply to individuals with impaired potassium excretion because of medical conditions (e.g., kidney disease) or the use of medications that impair potassium excretion. The NASEM committee also used an expanded DRI model to include a recommended intake level for a nutrient to reduce the risk of chronic disease, what they termed the chronic disease risk reduction intake (CDRR) . According to the model, a CDRR might be set for a nutrient like potassium when there is a causal relationship between a certain level of intake and a reduced risk of chronic disease based on evidence of at least moderate strength. However, the committee found the evidence to be insufficient to derive a CDRR for potassium. Sources of Potassium Food Potassium is found in a wide variety of plant and animal foods and in beverages. Many fruits and vegetables are excellent sources, as are some legumes (e.g., soybeans) and potatoes. Meats, poultry, fish, milk, yogurt, and nuts also contain potassium . Among starchy foods, whole-wheat flour and brown rice are much higher in potassium than their refined counterparts, white wheat flour and white rice . Milk, coffee, tea, other nonalcoholic beverages, and potatoes are the top sources of potassium in the diets of U.S. adults . Among children in the United States, milk, fruit juice, potatoes, and fruit are the top sources . It is estimated that the body absorbs about 85%–90% of dietary potassium . The forms of potassium in fruits and vegetables include potassium phosphate, sulfate, citrate and others but not potassium chloride (the form used in salt substitutes and some dietary supplements; see supplements section below) . Selected food sources of potassium are listed in Table 2.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for potassium is 4,700 mg for adults and children age 4 years and older . FDA requires the new food labels to list potassium content. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA's) FoodData Central lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides a comprehensive list of foods containing potassium ordered by nutrient content. The 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans also provides a list of foods containing potassium. Dietary supplements In dietary supplements, potassium is often present as potassium chloride, but many other forms—including potassium citrate, phosphate, aspartate, bicarbonate, and gluconate—are also used . The Supplement Facts panel on a dietary supplement label declares the amount of elemental potassium in the product, not the weight of the entire potassium-containing compound. Some dietary supplements contain potassium iodide in microgram amounts, but this ingredient serves as a form of the mineral iodine, not potassium. Not all multivitamin/mineral supplements contain potassium, but those that do typically provide about 80 mg potassium . Potassium-only supplements are also available, and most contain up to 99 mg potassium. Information on many dietary supplements that contain potassium is available in the Dietary Supplement Label Database from the National Institutes of Health, which contains label information from tens of thousands of dietary supplement products on the market. Many dietary supplement manufacturers and distributors limit the amount of potassium in their products to 99 mg (which is only about 2% of the DV) because of two concerns related to potassium-containing drugs. First, FDA has ruled that some oral drug products that contain potassium chloride and provide more than 99 mg potassium are not safe because they have been associated with small-bowel lesions . Second, FDA requires some potassium salts containing more than 99 mg potassium per tablet to be labeled with a warning about the reports of small-bowel lesions . In accordance with a ruling by Congress, FDA may not limit the amount of any nutrient, including potassium, in a dietary supplement, except for safety-related reasons . However, FDA has not issued a ruling about whether dietary supplements containing more than 99 mg potassium must carry a warning label . Only a few studies have examined how well the various forms of potassium in dietary supplements are absorbed. A 2016 dose-response trial found that humans absorb about 94% of potassium gluconate in supplements, and this absorption rate is similar to that of potassium from potatoes . According to an older study, liquid forms of potassium chloride (used as drugs to treat conditions such as digitalis intoxication or arrhythmias due to hypokalemia) are absorbed within a few hours . Enteric coated tablet forms of potassium chloride (designed to prevent dissolution in the stomach but allow it in the small intestine) are not absorbed as rapidly as liquid forms . Salt substitutes Many salt substitutes contain potassium chloride as a replacement for some or all of the sodium chloride in salt. The potassium content of these products varies widely, from about 440 mg to 2,800 mg potassium per teaspoon . Some people, such as those with kidney disease or who are taking certain medications, should consult their health care provider before taking salt substitutes because of the risk of hyperkalemia posed by the high levels of potassium in these products. Potassium Intakes and Status Dietary surveys consistently show that people in the United States consume less potassium than recommended, which is why the 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans identifies potassium as a nutrient of public health concern . According to data from the 2013–2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the average daily potassium intake from foods is 2,423 mg for males age 2–19, and 1,888 mg for females age 2–19 . In adults age 20 and over, the average daily potassium intake from foods is 3,016 mg for men and 2,320 mg for women. Average potassium intakes vary by race. Non-Hispanic blacks age 20 and older consume an average of 2,449 mg potassium per day. Average daily intakes are 2,695 mg for Hispanic whites and 2,697 mg for non-Hispanic whites . Use of potassium-containing dietary supplements does not significantly increase total potassium intakes among U.S. adults , probably because most potassium-containing dietary supplements provide no more than 99 mg potassium per serving . Data from NHANES 2013–2014 indicate that 12% of children and adults age 2 and over use supplements containing potassium, and among those who do, supplement use adds a mean of only 87 mg to total daily potassium intakes . Potassium Deficiency Insufficient potassium intakes can increase blood pressure, kidney stone risk, bone turnover, urinary calcium excretion, and salt sensitivity (meaning that changes in sodium intakes affect blood pressure to a greater than normal extent) . Severe potassium deficiency can cause hypokalemia, (serum potassium level less than about 3.6 mmol/L) . Hypokalemia affects up to 21% of hospitalized patients, usually because of the use of diuretics and other medications , but it is rare among healthy people with normal kidney function. Mild hypokalemia is characterized by constipation, fatigue, muscle weakness, and malaise . Moderate to severe hypokalemia (serum potassium level less than about 2.5 mmol/L) can cause polyuria (large volume of dilute urine); encephalopathy in patients with kidney disease; glucose intolerance; muscular paralysis; poor respiration; and cardiac arrhythmias, especially in individuals with underlying heart disease . Severe hypokalemia can be life threatening because of its effects on muscle contraction and, hence, cardiac function . Hypokalemia is rarely caused by low dietary potassium intake alone, but it can result from diarrhea due to potassium losses in the stool. It can also result from vomiting, which produces metabolic alkalosis, leading to potassium losses in the kidneys. Hypokalemia can also be caused by refeeding syndrome (the metabolic response to initial refeeding after a starvation period) because of potassium’s movement into cells, laxative abuse, diuretic use, eating clay (a type of pica), heavy sweating, or dialysis . Magnesium depletion can contribute to hypokalemia by increasing urinary potassium losses . It can also increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias by decreasing intracellular potassium concentrations. More than 50% of individuals with clinically significant hypokalemia might have magnesium deficiency . In people with hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia, both should be treated concurrently . Groups at Risk of Potassium Inadequacy Potassium inadequacy can occur with intakes that are below the AI but above the amount required to prevent hypokalemia. The following groups are more likely than others to have poor potassium status. People with inflammatory bowel diseases Potassium is secreted within the colon, and this process is normally balanced by absorption . However, in inflammatory bowel disease (including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis), potassium secretion increases, which can lead to poor potassium status. Inflammatory bowel diseases are also characterized by chronic diarrhea, which can further increase potassium excretion . People who use certain medications, including diuretics and laxatives Certain diuretics (e.g., thiazide diuretics) that are commonly used to treat high blood pressure increase urinary potassium excretion and can cause hypokalemia . Potassium-sparing diuretics, however, do not increase potassium excretion and can actually cause hyperkalemia. Large doses of laxatives and repeated use of enemas can also cause hypokalemia because they increase losses of potassium in stool. People with pica Pica is the persistent eating of non-nutritive substances, such as clay. When consumed, clay binds potassium in the gastrointestinal tract, which can increase potassium excretion and lead to hypokalemia . Cessation of pica combined with potassium supplementation can restore potassium status and resolve symptoms of potassium deficiency. Potassium and Health Because of potassium’s wide-ranging roles in the body, low intakes can increase the risk of illness. This section focuses on four diseases and disorders in which potassium might be involved: hypertension and stroke, kidney stones, bone health, and blood glucose control and type 2 diabetes. Hypertension and stroke Hypertension, a major risk factor for coronary heart disease and stroke, affects almost a third of Americans . According to an extensive body of literature, low potassium intakes increase the risk of hypertension, especially when combined with high sodium intakes [16,38-40]. Higher potassium intakes, in contrast, may help decrease blood pressure, in part by increasing vasodilation and urinary sodium excretion, which in turn reduces plasma volume ; this effect may be most pronounced in salt-sensitive individuals . The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating pattern, which emphasizes potassium from fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products, lowers systolic blood pressure by an average of 5.5 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 3.0 mmHg . The DASH eating pattern provides three times more potassium than the average American diet. However, it also increases intakes of other nutrients, such as magnesium and calcium, that are also associated with reductions in blood pressure, so potassium’s independent contribution cannot be determined. Additional information and sample DASH menu plans are available on the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute website. Results from most clinical trials suggest that potassium supplementation reduces blood pressure. A 2017 meta-analysis of 25 randomized controlled trials in 1,163 participants with hypertension found significant reductions in systolic blood pressure (by 4.48 mm Hg) and diastolic blood pressure (by 2.96 mmHg) with potassium supplementation, mostly as potassium chloride at 30–120 mmol/day potassium (1,173–4,692 mg), for 4–15 weeks . Another meta-analysis of 15 randomized controlled trials found that potassium supplements (mostly containing potassium chloride at 60–65 mEq/day potassium [2,346–2,541 mg]) for 4–24 weeks in 917 patients with normal blood pressure or hypertension who were not taking antihypertensive medications significantly reduced both systolic and diastolic blood pressure . The supplements had the greatest effect in patients with hypertension, reducing systolic blood pressure by a mean of 6.8 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 4.6 mmHg. Two earlier meta-analyses of 19 trials and 33 trials had similar findings. However, a Cochrane Review of six of the highest-quality trials found nonsignificant reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure with potassium supplementation . In 2018, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) published a systematic review of the effects of sodium and potassium intakes on chronic disease outcomes and their risk factors . The authors concluded that, based on observational studies, the associations between dietary potassium intakes and lower blood pressure in adults were inconsistent. They also found no evidence for an association between potassium intakes and the risk of hypertension. The authors did report, however, that potassium supplements (mostly containing potassium chloride) in doses ranging from 20 to 120 mmol/day (782 to 4,692 mg/day) for 1 to 36 months lowered both systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared to placebo. A similar analysis conducted by the NASEM committee that included 16 trials found that potassium supplements significantly lowered systolic blood pressure by a mean of 6.87 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 3.57 mmHg . However, the effects were stronger among studies including participants with hypertension; for studies including only participants without hypertension, the effects were not statistically significant. Based on 13 randomized controlled trials that primarily enrolled patients with hypertension, the AHRQ review found that the use of potassium-containing salt substitutes in place of sodium chloride significantly reduced systolic blood pressure in adults by a mean of 5.58 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 2.88 mmHg . However, reducing sodium intake decreased both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in adults, and increasing potassium intake via food or supplements did not reduce blood pressure any further. This finding suggests that at least some of the beneficial effects of potassium salt substitutes on blood pressure may be due to the accompanying reduction in sodium intake, rather than the increase in potassium intake. Higher potassium intakes have been associated with a decreased risk of stroke and possibly other cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) . A meta-analysis of 11 prospective cohort studies in 247,510 adults found that a 1,640 mg per day higher potassium intake was associated with a significant 21% lower risk of stroke as well as nonsignificant lower risks of coronary heart disease and total CVD . Similarly, the authors of a meta-analysis of nine cohort studies reported a significant 24% lower risk of stroke with higher potassium intakes and a nonsignificant reduction in coronary heart disease and CVD risk . However, the AHRQ review found inconsistent relationships between potassium intakes and risk of stroke based on 15 observational studies . Any beneficial effect of potassium on CVD is likely due to its antihypertensive effects. However, some research shows a benefit even when blood pressure is accounted for. For example, a 2016 meta-analysis of 16 cohort studies with a total of 639,440 participants found that those with the highest potassium intakes (median 103 mmol [4,027 mg] per day) had a 15% lower risk of stroke than those with the lowest potassium intakes (median 52.5 mmol [2,053 mg] per day). In addition, participants who consumed 90 mmol potassium/day (approximately 3,500 mg) had the lowest risk of stroke . However, even when blood pressure was accounted for, higher potassium intakes still produced a significant 13% lower risk of stroke. These findings suggest that other mechanisms (e.g., improved endothelial function and reduced free radical formation) may be involved . FDA has approved the following health claim: \"Diets containing foods that are a good source of potassium and that are low in sodium may reduce the risk of high blood pressure and stroke\" . Overall, the evidence suggests that consuming more potassium might have a favorable effect on blood pressure and stroke, and it might also help prevent other forms of CVD. However, more research on both dietary and supplemental potassium is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn. Kidney stones Kidney stones are most common in people age 40 to 60 . Stones containing calcium—in the form of calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate—are the most common type of kidney stone. Low potassium intakes impair calcium reabsorption within the kidney, increasing urinary calcium excretion and potentially causing hypercalciuria and kidney stones . Low urinary levels of citrate also contribute to kidney stone development. Observational studies show inverse associations between dietary potassium intakes and risk of kidney stones. In a cohort of 45,619 men age 40 to 75 years with no history of kidney stones, those with the highest potassium intakes (≥4,042 mg/day on average) had a 51% lower risk of kidney stones over 4 years of follow-up than those with the lowest intakes (≤2,895 mg/day) . Similarly, in more than 90,000 women age 34–59 who participated in the Nurses' Health Study and had no history of kidney stones, those who consumed an average of more than 4,099 mg of potassium per day had a 35% lower risk of kidney stones over a 12-year follow-up period than those who averaged less than 2,407 mg of potassium per day . Some research suggests that supplementation with potassium citrate reduces hypercalciuria as well as the risk of kidney stone formation and growth . In a clinical trial of 57 patients with at least two kidney stones (either calcium oxalate or calcium oxalate plus calcium phosphate) over the previous 2 years and hypocitraturia (low urinary citrate levels), supplementation with 30–60 mEq potassium citrate (providing 1,173 to 2,346 mg potassium) for 3 years significantly reduced kidney stone formation compared with placebo . This study was included in a 2015 Cochrane Review of seven studies that examined the effects of potassium citrate, potassium-sodium citrate, and potassium-magnesium citrate supplementation on the prevention and treatment of calcium-containing kidney stones in a total of 477 participants, most of whom had calcium oxalate stones . The potassium citrate salts significantly reduced the risk of new stones and reduced stone size. However, the proposed mechanism involves citrate, not potassium per se; citrate forms complexes with urinary calcium and increases urine pH, inhibiting the formation of calcium oxalate crystals . The authors of the AHRQ review concluded that observational studies suggest an association between higher potassium intakes and lower risk of kidney stones. However, they also found the evidence insufficient to determine whether potassium supplements are effective because only one trial that addressed this question met their inclusion criteria. Additional research is needed to fully understand the potential link between dietary and supplemental potassium and the risk of kidney stones. Bone health Observational studies suggest that increased consumption of potassium from fruits and vegetables is associated with increased bone mineral density . This evidence, combined with evidence from metabolic studies and a few clinical trials, suggests that dietary potassium may improve bone health. The underlying mechanisms are unclear, but one hypothesis is that potassium helps protect bone through its effect on acid-base balance . Diets that are high in acid-forming foods, such as meats and cereal grains, contribute to metabolic acidosis and might have an adverse effect on bone. Alkaline components in the form of potassium salts (potassium bicarbonate or citrate, but not potassium chloride) from food or potassium supplements might counter this effect and help preserve bone tissue. In the Framingham Heart Study for example, higher potassium intake was associated with significantly greater bone mineral density in 628 elderly men and women . In another study, the DASH eating pattern significantly reduced biochemical markers of bone turnover . This eating pattern has a lower acid load than typical Western diets and is also high in calcium and magnesium, in addition to potassium, so any independent contribution of potassium cannot be determined. Only a few clinical trials have examined the effects of potassium supplements on markers of bone health. One trial found that supplementation with potassium citrate at either 60 mmol/day (2,346 mg potassium) or 90 mmol/day (3,519 mg potassium) for 6 months significantly reduced urinary calcium excretion compared with placebo in 52 healthy men and women older than 55 years . In another clinical trial, 201 healthy adults age 65 years or older received daily supplementation with 60 mEq potassium citrate (providing 2,346 mg potassium) or placebo as well as 500 mg/day calcium (as calcium carbonate) and 400 International Units (IU)/day vitamin D3 for 2 years . Potassium supplementation significantly increased bone mineral density at the lumbar spine and bone microarchitecture compared with placebo. In a similar clinical trial among older adults, supplemental potassium bicarbonate (mean doses of 2,893 or 4,340 mg/day potassium) for 84 days significantly reduced biochemical markers of bone turnover and urinary calcium excretion . Conversely, a clinical trial in 276 postmenopausal women age 55–65 years found that supplementation with potassium citrate at either 18.5 mEq/day (providing 723 mg potassium) or 55.5 mEq/day (2,170 mg potassium) for 2 years did not significantly reduce bone turnover or increase bone mineral density at the hip or lumbar spine compared with placebo . Overall, higher intakes of potassium from diets that emphasize fruits and vegetables might improve bone health. However, more research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and tease out potassium’s individual contribution. Blood glucose control and type 2 diabetes Type 2 diabetes is a growing public health concern that currently affects almost 12% of U.S. adults . Although individuals with obesity have an elevated risk of type 2 diabetes, other metabolic factors also play a role. Because potassium is needed for insulin secretion from pancreatic cells, hypokalemia impairs insulin secretion and could lead to glucose intolerance . This effect has been observed mainly with long-term use of diuretics (particularly those containing thiazides) or hyperaldosteronism (excessive aldosterone production), which both increase urinary potassium losses, but it can occur in healthy individuals as well . Numerous observational studies of adults have found associations between lower potassium intakes or lower serum or urinary potassium levels and increased rates of fasting glucose, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes [66-72]. These associations might be stronger in African Americans, who tend to have lower potassium intakes, than in whites . For example, one study of 1,066 adults age 18–30 years without diabetes found that those with urinary potassium levels in the lowest quintile were more than twice as likely to develop type 2 diabetes over 15 years of follow-up than those in the highest quintile . Among 4,754 participants from the same study with potassium intake data, African Americans with lower potassium intakes had a significantly greater risk of type 2 diabetes over 20 years of follow-up than those with higher intakes, but this association was not found in whites. In another observational study, which analyzed data from 84,360 women age 34–59 years participating in the Nurses’ Health Study, those in the highest quintile of potassium intake had a 38% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes over 6 years of follow-up than those in the lowest quintile . Serum potassium levels were inversely associated with fasting glucose levels in 5,415 participants age 45–84 years from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, but these levels had no significant association with diabetes risk over 8 years of follow-up . Although observational studies suggest that potassium status is linked to blood glucose control and type 2 diabetes, this association has not been adequately evaluated in clinical trials. In a small clinical trial in 29 African American adults with prediabetes and low to normal serum potassium levels (3.3–4.0 mmol/L), supplementation with 40 mEq (1,564 mg) potassium (as potassium chloride) for 3 months significantly lowered fasting glucose levels, but it did not affect glucose or insulin measures during an oral glucose tolerance test . The findings from studies conducted to date are promising. However, more research, including randomized controlled trials, is needed before potassium’s link with blood glucose control and type 2 diabetes can be confirmed. Health Risks from Excessive Potassium Dietary potassium In healthy people with normal kidney function, high dietary potassium intakes do not pose a health risk because the kidneys eliminate excess amounts in the urine . Although case reports indicate that very large doses of potassium supplements can cause heart abnormalities and death, the NASEM committee concluded that these reports do not provide sufficient evidence to set a UL . In addition, there is no evidence that high intakes of potassium cause hyperkalemia in adults with normal kidney function or other adverse effects. Therefore, the committee did not set a UL for potassium. However, in people with impaired urinary potassium excretion due to chronic kidney disease or the use of certain medications, such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or potassium-sparing diuretics, even dietary potassium intakes below the AI can cause hyperkalemia . Hyperkalemia can also occur in people with type 1 diabetes, congestive heart failure, adrenal insufficiency, or liver disease . Individuals at risk of hyperkalemia should consult a physician or registered dietitian about appropriate potassium intakes from all sources. Information on low-potassium diets is also available from the National Kidney Disease Education Program. Although hyperkalemia can be asymptomatic, severe cases can cause muscle weakness, paralysis, heart palpitations, paresthesias (a burning or prickling sensation in the extremities), and cardiac arrhythmias that could be life threatening . Potassium from dietary supplements, salt substitutes, and medications Potassium supplements can cause minor gastrointestinal side effects . Chronic ingestion of doses of potassium supplements (e.g., up to 15,600 mg for 5 days) in healthy people can increase plasma levels of potassium, but not beyond the normal range . However, very high amounts of potassium supplements or salt substitutes that contain potassium could exceed the kidney’s capacity to excrete potassium, causing acute hyperkalemia even in healthy individuals. The use of potassium salts in certain medications has been associated with small-bowel lesions, causing obstruction, hemorrhage, and perforation . For this reason, FDA requires some oral drugs providing more than 99 mg of potassium to be labeled with a warning. Interactions with Medications Several types of medications have the potential to affect potassium status in ways that could be dangerous. A few examples are provided below. People taking these and other medications should discuss their potassium intakes and status with their health care providers. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers ACE inhibitors, such as benazepril (Lotensin), and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) such as losartan (Cozaar), are used to treat hypertension and heart failure, slow progression of kidney disease in patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes, and decrease morbidity and mortality after myocardial infarction [75-77]. These medications reduce urinary potassium excretion, which can lead to hyperkalemia. Experts recommend monitoring potassium status in people taking ACE inhibitors or ARBs, especially if they have other risk factors for hyperkalemia, such as impaired kidney function . Potassium-sparing diuretics Potassium-sparing diuretics, such as amiloride (Midamor) and spironolactone (Aldactone), reduce the excretion of potassium in the urine and can cause hyperkalemia . Experts recommend monitoring potassium status in people taking these medications, especially if they have impaired kidney function or other risk factors for hyperkalemia . Loop and thiazide diuretics Treatment with loop diuretics, such as furosemide (Lasix) and bumetanide (Bumex), and thiazide diuretics, such as chlorothiazide (Diuril) and metolazone (Zaroxolyn), increases urinary potassium excretion and can lead to hypokalemia . Experts recommend monitoring potassium status in people taking these medications and initiating potassium supplementation if warranted . Potassium and Healthful Diets The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\" For more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate.

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet. Introduction Phosphorus, an essential mineral, is naturally present in many foods and available as a dietary supplement. Phosphorus is a component of bones, teeth, DNA, and RNA . In the form of phospholipids, phosphorus is also a component of cell membrane structure and of the body’s key energy source, adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Many proteins and sugars in the body are phosphorylated. In addition, phosphorus plays key roles in regulation of gene transcription, activation of enzymes, maintenance of normal pH in extracellular fluid, and intracellular energy storage. In humans, phosphorus makes up about 1% to 1.4% of fat-free mass. Of this amount, 85% is in bones and teeth, and the other 15% is distributed throughout the blood and soft tissues . Many different types of foods contain phosphorus, mainly in the form of phosphates and phosphate esters . However, phosphorus in seeds and unleavened breads is in the form of phytic acid, the storage form of phosphorus . Because human intestines lack the phytase enzyme, much phosphorus in this form is unavailable for absorption . Phosphorus undergoes passive absorption in the small intestine, although some is absorbed by active transport . Phosphorus and calcium are interrelated because hormones, such as vitamin D and parathyroid hormone (PTH), regulate the metabolism of both minerals. In addition, phosphorus and calcium make up hydroxyapatite, the main structural component in bones and tooth enamel . The combination of high phosphorus intakes with low calcium intakes increases serum PTH levels, but evidence is mixed on whether the increased hormone levels decrease bone mineral density [2,4-6]. The kidneys, bones, and intestines regulate phosphorus homeostasis, which requires maintenance of urinary losses at equivalent levels to net phosphorus absorption and ensuring that equal amounts of phosphorus are deposited and resorbed from bone . Several hormones, including estrogen and adrenaline, also affect phosphorus homeostasis. When kidney function declines, as in chronic kidney failure, the body cannot excrete phosphate efficiently, and serum levels rise . Although phosphorus status is not typically assessed, phosphate can be measured in both serum and plasma . In adults, normal phosphate concentration in serum or plasma is 2.5 to 4.5 mg/dL (0.81 to 1.45 mmol/L) . Hypophosphatemia is defined as serum phosphate concentrations lower than the low end of the normal range, whereas a concentration higher than the high end of the range indicates hyperphosphatemia. However, plasma and serum phosphate levels do not necessarily reflect whole-body phosphorus content . Recommended Intakes Intake recommendations for phosphorus and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine . DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following: Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects Table 1 lists the current RDAs for phosphorus . For infants from birth to 12 months, the FNB established an AI for phosphorus that is equivalent to the mean intake of phosphorus in healthy, breastfed infants. Table 1: Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for Phosphorus Birth to 6 months*: Male: 100 mg, Female: 100 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  7–12 months*: Male: 275 mg, Female: 275 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  1–3 years: Male: 460 mg, Female: 460 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  4–8 years: Male: 500 mg, Female: 500 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  9–13 years: Male: 1,250 mg, Female: 1,250 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  14–18 years: Male: 1,250 mg, Female: 1,250 mg, Pregnancy: 1,250 mg, Lactation: 1,250 mg 19+ years: Male: 700 mg, Female: 700 mg, Pregnancy: 700 mg, Lactation: 700 mg *Adequate Intake (AI) Sources of Phosphorus Food Many different types of foods contain phosphorus, including dairy products, meats and poultry, fish, eggs, nuts, legumes, vegetables, and grains . In the United States, dairy products contribute about 20% of total phosphorus intakes, and bakery products (e.g., breads, tortillas, and sweet bakery products) contribute 10% . Vegetables and chicken contribute 5% each. The absorption rate for the phosphorus naturally contained in food is 40%–70%; phosphorus from animal sources has a higher absorption rate than that from plants . Calcium from foods and supplements can bind to some of the phosphorus in foods and prevent its absorption . According to one analysis, a very high calcium intake of 2,500 mg/day binds 0.61–1.05 g phosphorus . In infants, phosphorus bioavailability ranges from 85%–90% for human milk to approximately 59% for soy-based formulas . Phosphate additives (e.g., phosphoric acid, sodium phosphate, and sodium polyphosphate) are present in many foods, especially processed food products. These additives are used for such purposes as preserving moisture or color and enhancing and stabilizing frozen foods . Foods containing these additives have an average of 67 mg more phosphorus per serving than similar foods not containing the additives, and these additives contribute to overall phosphorus intakes in the United States . Phosphate additives are estimated to contribute 300 to 1,000 mg to total daily phosphorus intakes , or about 10%–50% of phosphorus intakes in Western countries . The use of phosphate additives is rising, as are the amounts of these additives in foods . The absorption rate for the phosphorus in phosphate additives is approximately 70% . Several food sources of phosphorus are listed in Table 2. Table 2: Phosphorus Content of Selected Foods *DV = Daily Value. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for phosphorus is 1,250 mg for adults and children age 4 years and older . FDA does not require food labels to list phosphorus content unless phosphorus has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) FoodData Central lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides a comprehensive list of foods containing phosphorus arranged by nutrient content. Dietary supplements Phosphorus is available in dietary supplements containing only phosphorus, supplements containing phosphorus in combination with other ingredients, and a few multivitamin/mineral products . Phosphorus in supplements is usually in the form of phosphate salts (e.g., dipotassium phosphate or disodium phosphate) or phospholipids (e.g., phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylserine). Products typically provide 10% or less of the DV for phosphorus, but a small proportion deliver more than 100% . The bioavailability of phosphate salts is approximately 70% . The bioavailability of other forms of phosphorus in supplements has not been determined in humans. Phosphorus Intakes and Status Most Americans consume more than the recommended amounts of phosphorus. Data from the 2015–2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) show that among children and teens age 2–19 years, the average daily phosphorus intake from foods is 1,237 mg . In adults age 20 and older, the average daily phosphorus intake from foods is 1,189 mg for women and 1,596 mg for men. According to an analysis of 2013–2014 NHANES data, the average daily phosphorus intake from both foods and supplements is 1,301 mg for women and 1,744 mg for men . Some experts question whether the dietary data collection instruments used by NHANES and other large population-based studies capture true dietary phosphorus intakes because these surveys do not account for the additional contributions of phosphate additives in foods . Phosphorus Deficiency Phosphorus deficiency (hypophosphatemia) is rare in the United States and is almost never the result of low dietary intakes . The effects of hypophosphatemia can include anorexia, anemia, proximal muscle weakness, skeletal effects (bone pain, rickets, and osteomalacia), increased infection risk, paresthesias, ataxia, and confusion . In most cases, hypophosphatemia is caused by medical conditions, such as hyperparathyroidism, kidney tubule defects, and diabetic ketoacidosis . Groups at Risk of Phosphorus Inadequacy The following groups are most likely to have inadequate phosphorus status. Preterm newborns Phosphorus deficiency in preterm infants is one of the main causes, along with calcium deficiency, of osteopenia of prematurity (impaired bone mineralization) . Because two-thirds of fetal bone mineral content is acquired during the third trimester of pregnancy, preterm infants are born with low stores of calcium and phosphorus in their bones . The benefits of providing extra phosphorus and calcium for bone health in preterm babies is not clear. However, milk fortified with higher amounts of these minerals and other nutritional components is typically recommended to support overall growth and development . People with genetic phosphate regulation disorders Rare genetic disorders of phosphorus metabolism include X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets . In addition to rickets, patients with this disease develop osteomalacia, pseudofractures (formation of new bone and thickened connective tissue over injured bone), enthesopathy (mineralization of ligaments and tendons), and dental damage. Other rare genetic disorders of phosphorus regulation associated with rickets include autosomal-dominant and autosomal-recessive hypophosphatemic rickets and hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria . Treatment typically consists of vitamin D and phosphorus supplementation from diagnosis until growth is complete . Patients with severe malnutrition People with severe protein or calorie malnutrition can develop refeeding syndrome, also known as refeeding hypophosphatemia, within 2 to 5 days of starting enteral or parenteral nutrition because of the shift in metabolism from a catabolic to an anabolic state . Causes of malnutrition that can lead to refeeding syndrome include chronic diseases (e.g., cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or cirrhosis), very low birthweight, cachexia, low body weight, anorexia nervosa, excessive alcohol intake, and chewing or swallowing problems. The effects of refeeding syndrome can include impaired neuromuscular function, hypoventilation, respiratory failure, impaired blood clotting, confusion, coma, cardiac arrest, congestive heart failure, and death . Prophylactic administration of phosphorus and thiamin in patients at risk of refeeding syndrome can prevent this condition . Phosphorus and Health This section focuses on two diseases in which phosphorus might play a role: chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Chronic kidney disease CKD, which affects 5%–10% of the population worldwide, can lead to CVD and early death . As kidney function declines, phosphate excretion becomes less efficient and serum phosphate concentration rises. As a result, PTH and fibroblast growth factor 23 lose their ability to suppress phosphorus resorption by the kidneys . Increased phosphorus retention often leads to CKD mineral and bone disorder. This systemic condition is characterized by abnormal metabolism of phosphorus, calcium, PTH, and/or vitamin D; abnormal bone turnover, mineralization, volume, growth, or strength; and vascular or other soft-tissue calcification . An analysis of 2003–2006 NHANES data illustrates the association between CKD and phosphate levels. In 7,895 adults (mean age 47 years, 52% Caucasian), participants with reduced kidney function had significantly higher serum phosphate levels (4.12 mg/dL) than those with normal kidney function (3.83 mg/dL) . Several studies have shown an increased risk of mortality or disease progression in patients who have CKD and high phosphate levels [46-48]. A meta-analysis of nine cohort studies in 199,289 patients age 50–73 years with end-stage renal disease showed, for example, that patients on dialysis with the highest phosphate levels (greater than 5.2–7.5 mg/dL, depending on the study) had a 39% greater risk of all-cause mortality during 12 to 97.6 months of follow-up than those with normal phosphate levels (defined in the analysis as 3.0–5.5 mg/dL, depending on the study) . However, high phosphate levels do not seem to have the same associations in people with milder CKD . For example, an analysis of NHANES III (1988–1994) data on 1,105 adults (mean age 67–71 years, depending on their phosphate intake tertile) with moderate CKD found that serum phosphate levels were very similar, regardless of phosphate intake—3.6 mg/dL in the lowest tertile of phosphorus intake (532 mg/day) and 3.5 mg/dL in the highest intake tertile (1,478 mg/day)—and that high phosphorus intakes were not associated with increased mortality rates over 6–12 years, possibly because these patients did not have severe CKD . To prevent the complications of high phosphate levels in patients with CKD, clinicians sometimes encourage patients to limit their phosphorus intakes (e.g., by replacing most animal proteins in their diets with plant-based protein sources, whose phosphorus is less bioavailable) and eat more calcium-rich foods . Some evidence shows that replacing foods containing phosphorus additives with foods that lack these additives can reduce serum phosphate levels . However, restricting phosphorus intakes can also reduce protein intakes because many foods (e.g., fish, meats, and legumes) containing large amounts of phosphorus also contain large amounts of protein . Furthermore, a Cochrane Review of nine studies in 634 participants with CKD followed for 1–18 months found only limited, low-quality evidence indicating that dietary interventions might have a positive impact on CKD mineral and bone disorder . In its clinical practice guideline for CKD mineral and bone disorder, the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidelines development group recommends that patients with stage 3–5 (more severe) CKD limit dietary phosphorus intake either alone or in combination with other treatments to reduce phosphate levels . However, the group notes that clinical trial data showing that treatments that lower serum phosphate levels improve patient-centered outcomes are lacking, and it acknowledges that this recommendation is weak. Additional studies are needed on the link between phosphate concentrations and both CKD risk and morbidity in patients with CKD as well as the impact of dietary phosphorus restriction in patients with this disease. Cardiovascular disease Several observational studies support a link between high phosphate levels and CVD risk in people with and without a history of CVD . For example, an analysis of 14,675 participants (55% women) without atrial fibrillation found, based on almost 20 years of follow-up, that each 1 mg/dL increase in serum phosphate was associated with a 13% higher risk of atrial fibrillation . Several large epidemiologic studies have also found associations between higher serum phosphate concentrations and risk of cardiovascular mortality in healthy adults. A meta-analysis of data from four prospective cohort studies with 13,515 participants (with percentages of male participants ranging, depending on the study, from 44 to 100% and mean ages from 43 to 74 years) followed for 6–29 years showed a 36% higher risk of cardiovascular mortality in those with the highest phosphate concentration (2.79–4.0 mg/dL) compared with participants with a phosphate concentration of 0.61–3.28 mg/dL . A subsequent study not included in this meta-analysis in 13,165 nonpregnant adult participants (mean age 43–45 years, 52% female) in NHANES III (1988–1994) followed for a median of 14.3 years found that for every 1 mg/dL increase in phosphate above 3.5 mg/dL, the risk of death rose by 35% and the risk of cardiovascular death increased by 45% . Not all observational data, however, support a link between serum phosphate concentrations and CVD risk. A post hoc analysis of data from 7,269 postmenopausal women, mean age 66 years, with osteoporosis found no association between higher serum phosphate levels and risk of cardiovascular outcomes during 4 years of follow-up . In spite of the evidence supporting a link between increased phosphate levels and CVD risk, the literature offers no evidence on whether restricting phosphorus consumption can prevent CVD in healthy adults . Additional research is needed to address this issue. Health Risks from Excessive Phosphorus High phosphorus intakes rarely produce adverse effects in healthy people. Although some studies have found associations between high phosphorus intakes (1,000 mg/day or higher) and cardiovascular, kidney, and bone adverse effects as well as an increased risk of death , others have found no link between high intakes and increased disease risk . The ULs for phosphorus from food and supplements for healthy individuals are therefore based on intakes associated with normal serum phosphate concentrations . The ULs do not apply to individuals who are receiving supplemental phosphorus under medical supervision. Table 3: Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for Phosphorus Birth to 6 months*: Male: None established*, Female: None established*, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  7–12 months*: Male: None established*, Female: None established*, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  1–3 years: Male: 3,000 mg, Female: 3,000 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  4–8 years: Male: 3,000 mg, Female: 3,000 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  9–13 years: Male: 4,000 mg, Female: 4,000 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  14–18 years: Male: 4,000 mg, Female: 4,000 mg, Pregnancy: 3,500 mg, Lactation: 4,000 mg 19–50 years: Male: 4,000 mg, Female: 4,000 mg, Pregnancy: 3,500 mg, Lactation: 4,000 mg 51–70 years: Male: 4,000 mg, Female: 4,000 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  71+ years: Male: 3,000 mg, Female: 3,000 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  * Breast milk, formula, and food should be the only sources of phosphorus for infants. According to one analysis of data on healthy U.S. adults using NHANES III data collected in 1988–1994, high phosphorus intakes (1,000 mg/day or more) were associated with increased rates of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in adults through 2006 . These intakes are twice the RDA for adults—less than daily intakes in many men (especially those who are white or Hispanic) and well below the UL. The implications of this analysis for the potential adverse effects of high phosphorus intakes are unclear. High phosphorus intakes might be signs of diets that are unhealthy in other ways, for example . Very high phosphorus intakes over short periods (e.g., two 6,600 mg doses of sodium phosphate taken in 1 day) can cause hyperphosphatemia . The main effects of hyperphosphatemia include changes in the hormones that regulate calcium metabolism and calcification of nonskeletal tissues, especially in the kidney . Interactions with Medications Phosphorus can interact with certain medications, and some medications can have an adverse effect on phosphate levels. Two examples are provided below. Individuals taking these and other medications on a regular basis should discuss their phosphorus status with their health care providers. Antacids Antacids that contain aluminum hydroxide, such as Maalox HRF and Rulox, bind phosphorus in the intestines, and their chronic use for 3 months or longer can therefore lead to hypophosphatemia . These drugs can also aggravate existing phosphate deficiency. Antacids containing calcium carbonate (Rolaids, Tums, Maalox) also decrease instestinal absorption of dietary phosphorus . Laxatives Some laxatives, such as Fleet Prep Kit #1, contain sodium phosphate, and ingesting these products can increase serum phosphate levels . After 13 reports of deaths associated with taking one dose that was higher than recommended on the label of a laxative containing sodium phosphate, FDA issued a warning that these products are potentially dangerous if more than recommended doses are taken, especially in people with kidney disease, heart disease, or dehydration . Phosphorus and Healthful Diets The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ...

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet. Introduction Iodine is a trace element that is naturally present in some foods, is added to some types of salt, and is available as a dietary supplement. Iodine is an essential component of the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Thyroid hormones regulate many important biochemical reactions, including protein synthesis and enzymatic activity, and are critical determinants of metabolic activity . They are also required for proper skeletal and central nervous system development in fetuses and infants . Thyroid function is primarily regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), also known as thyrotropin. It is secreted by the pituitary gland to control thyroid hormone production and secretion, thereby protecting the body from hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism . TSH secretion increases thyroidal uptake of iodine and stimulates the synthesis and release of T3 and T4. In the absence of sufficient iodine, TSH levels remain elevated, leading to goiter, an enlargement of the thyroid gland that reflects the body’s attempt to trap more iodine from the circulation and produce thyroid hormones. Iodine may have other physiological functions in the body as well. For example, it appears to play a role in immune response and might have a beneficial effect on mammary dysplasia and fibrocystic breast disease . The earth’s soils contain varying amounts of iodine, which in turn affects the iodine content of crops. In some regions of the world, iodine-deficient soils are common, increasing the risk of iodine deficiency among people who consume foods primarily from those areas. Salt iodization programs, which many countries have implemented, have dramatically reduced the prevalence of iodine deficiency worldwide . Iodine in food and iodized salt is present in several chemical forms including sodium and potassium salts, inorganic iodine (I2), iodate, and iodide, the reduced form of iodine . Iodine rarely occurs as the element but rather as a salt; for this reason, it is referred to as iodide and not iodine. Iodide is quickly and almost completely absorbed in the stomach and duodenum. Iodate is reduced in the gastrointestinal tract and absorbed as iodide . When iodide enters the circulation, the thyroid gland concentrates it in appropriate amounts for thyroid hormone synthesis and most of the remaining amount is excreted in the urine . The iodine-replete healthy adult has about 15–20 mg of iodine, 70%–80% of which is contained in the thyroid . Median urinary iodine concentrations of 100–199 mcg/L in children and adults, 150–249 mcg/L in pregnant women and >100 mcg/L in lactating women indicate iodine intakes are adequate . Values lower than 100 mcg/L in children and nonpregnant adults indicate insufficient iodine intake, although iodine deficiency is not classified as severe until urinary iodine levels are lower than 20 mcg/L. Recommended Intakes Intake recommendations for iodine and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies (formerly National Academy of Sciences) . DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and gender , include the following: Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects Table 1 lists the current RDAs for iodine . For infants from birth to 12 months, the FNB established an AI for iodine that is equivalent to the mean intake of iodine in healthy, breastfed infants in the United States. Table 1: Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for Iodine Birth to 6 months: Male: 110 mcg*, Female: 110 mcg*, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  7–12 months: Male: 130 mcg*, Female: 130 mcg*, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  1–3 years: Male: 90 mcg, Female: 90 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  4–8 years: Male: 90 mcg, Female: 90 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  9–13 years: Male: 120 mcg, Female: 120 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  14–18 years: Male: 150 mcg, Female: 150 mcg, Pregnancy: 220 mcg, Lactation: 290 mcg 19+ years: Male: 150 mcg, Female: 150 mcg, Pregnancy: 220 mcg, Lactation: 290 mcg * Adequate Intake (AI) The World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Children’s Fund, and the International Council for the Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders recommend a slightly higher iodine intake for pregnant women of 250 mcg per day . Sources of Iodine Food Seaweed (such as kelp, nori, kombu, and wakame) is one of the best food sources of iodine . Other good sources include fish and other seafood as well as eggs (see Table 2). Iodine is also present in human breast milk and infant formulas . Dairy products contain iodine. However, the amount of iodine in dairy products varies by whether the cows received iodine feed supplements and whether iodophor sanitizing agents were used to clean the cows and milk-processing equipment . For example, an analysis of 59 samples of nonfat milk found a range of 38 to 160 mcg per cup (with an average of 84 mcg/cup used for Table 2) . Plant-based beverages used as milk substitutes, such as soy and almond beverages, contain relatively small amounts of iodine. Most commercially prepared bread contains very little iodine unless the manufacturer has used potassium iodate or calcium iodate as a dough conditioner . Manufacturers list dough conditioners as an ingredient on product labels but are not required to include iodine on the Nutrition Facts label , even though these conditioners provide a substantial amount of iodine. According to 2019 data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Branded Food Products Database, approximately 20% of ingredient labels for white bread, whole-wheat bread, hamburger buns, and hot dog buns listed iodate . Pasta is not a source of iodine unless it is prepared in water containing iodized salt because it absorbs some of the iodine . Most fruits and vegetables are poor sources of iodine, and the amounts they contain are affected by the iodine content of the soil, fertilizer use, and irrigation practices . This variability affects the iodine content of meat and animal products because of its impact on the iodine content of foods that the animals consume . The iodine amounts in different seaweed species also vary greatly. For example, commercially available seaweeds in whole or sheet form have iodine concentrations ranging from 16 mcg/g to 2,984 mcg/g . For these reasons, the values for the foods listed in Table 2 are approximate but can be used as a guide for estimating iodine intakes.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for iodine is 150 mcg for adults and children age 4 years and older . FDA does not require food labels to list iodine content unless iodine has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet. **About 20% of bread products in the United States list iodate dough conditioners on their labels. Products made without these conditioners contain very little iodine. The USDA, FDA, and ODS-NIH Database for the Iodine Content of Common Foods lists the iodine content of numerous foods and beverages. Iodized salt The United States, Canada, and dozens of other countries have salt-iodization programs . In the United States, salt manufacturers have been adding iodine to table salt since the 1920s, although this practice is still voluntary . FDA has approved the use of potassium iodide and cuprous iodide for salt iodization , whereas the WHO recommends the use of potassium iodate due to its greater stability, particularly in warm, damp, or tropical climates . According to its label, iodized salt in the United States contains 45 mcg iodine/g salt (between 1/8 and 1/4 teaspoon); measured salt samples have an average of 47.5–50.7 mcg iodine/g salt . However, most salt intake in the United States comes from processed foods, and food manufacturers almost always use noniodized salt in these foods. If they do use iodized salt, they must list the salt as iodized in the ingredient list on the food label . Specialty salts, such as sea salt, kosher salt, Himalayan salt, and fleur de sel, are not usually iodized. Product labels will indicate if the salt is iodized or provides iodide. As shown in Table 2, noniodized sea salt provides virtually no iodine . Dietary supplements In dietary supplements, iodine is often present as potassium iodide or sodium iodide . Supplements containing kelp, a seaweed that contains iodine, are also available. A small study found that people absorb potassium iodide almost completely (96.4%) . Many multivitamin/mineral supplements contain iodine, often at a dose of 150 mcg , and some, but not all, prenatal supplements contain iodine . Dietary supplements containing only iodine are also available, and many contain high doses, sometimes above the UL . Many dietary supplements that contain iodine are listed in the Dietary Supplement Label Database from the NIH . This database contains label information from tens of thousands of dietary supplement products on the U.S. market. Iodine Intakes and Status Iodine intakes The Total Diet Study (TDS), an FDA monitoring program, provides estimated iodine intakes of the U.S. population . Through the TDS program, foods that represent the average U.S. diet are purchased and analyzed for several components, including iodine. Based on analytical results from TDS food samples collected between 2008 and 2012, combined with food consumption estimates, the average daily iodine intake in the United States was 216 mcg/day, with a range from 141 to 296 mcg/day across all age and gender groups . These intakes meet or exceed the EAR for all groups. TDS data do not include iodine that people obtain from the discretionary use of iodized salt . Because many U.S. households use iodized salt, TDS data likely underestimate the true iodine intake of most U.S. residents. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) collected between 1999 and 2004 indicate that 28–29% of adults use iodine-containing dietary supplements ; this use also adds to the population’s total iodine intake. Iodine status of the general U.S. population Iodine status is typically assessed using urinary iodine measurements. Urinary iodine reflects dietary iodine intake directly because people excrete more than 90% of dietary iodine in the urine . Spot urine iodine measurements are a useful indicator of iodine status within populations . However, multiple 24-hour urinary iodine or multiple spot urine measurements are more accurate for individuals . Median urinary iodine concentrations, from spot samples collected as part of a large survey, can be used to characterize the iodine status of populations . However, because spot samples are not a suitable indicator of individual iodine status , these measurements cannot be used to diagnose individual cases of iodine deficiency or to identify the proportion of a population with iodine deficiency or with excessive iodine intakes . For a population of school-age children or nonpregnant adults to be iodine sufficient, median urinary iodine concentrations should be greater than 100 mcg/L and no more than 20% of the population should have values lower than 50 mcg/L . Urinary iodine measurements from NHANES have been used since 1971 to monitor the iodine status of the U.S. population . Since the inception of the NHANES monitoring program, urinary iodine measurements have shown that the general U.S. population is iodine sufficient. This is despite the fact that urinary iodine levels decreased by more than 50% between 1971–1974 and 1988–1994 . Much of this decline was a result of decreased levels of iodine in milk due to the reduced use of iodine-containing feed supplements and iodophor sanitizing agents in the dairy industry as well as the reduced use of iodate dough conditioners by commercial bakers. The use of erythrosine, an iodine-containing food dye commonly used in fruit-flavored breakfast cereals, also decreased during this time though it is unclear to what extent this change actually affected urinary iodine levels because the bioavailability of iodine from erythrosine has been found to be low . This sharp decline in urinary iodine levels caused some concern during the late 1990s that the iodine sufficiency of the U.S. population could be at risk if this trend continued . More recent NHANES measurements indicate that urinary iodine levels have stabilized in the general U.S. population. During 2007–2008, NHANES participants age 6 years and older had a median urinary iodine concentration of 164 mcg/L . Among women of reproductive age, the median urinary iodine concentration in NHANES 2007–2014 was 119 mcg/L . These values have essentially remained unchanged in the last three NHANES surveys, indicating that the dietary iodine intake of the general U.S. population has remained stable since 2000 . Iodine status of U.S. pregnant women According to the WHO, a median urinary iodine concentration of 150–249 mcg/L indicates adequate iodine nutrition during pregnancy, while values less than 150 mcg/L are considered insufficient . Analyses of NHANES datasets from 2003 to 2014 indicate that a substantial portion of pregnant women in the United States are iodine insufficient. Median urinary iodine concentrations for pregnant women participating in NHANES surveys were 181 mcg/L in 2003–2004, 153 mcg/L in 2001–2006, 125 mcg/L in 2005–2008, and 144 mcg/L in 2007–2014 [32,36-38]. Suboptimal iodine status during pregnancy has also been observed in Australia . Pregnant women who do not consume dairy products may be particularly at risk of iodine insufficiency. According to NHANES 2001–2006 data, pregnant women who consumed no dairy products in the previous 24 hours had a median urinary iodine concentration of only 100 mcg/L, compared with 163 mcg/L among consumers of dairy . Women who restrict their dietary salt intake also have lower urinary iodine concentrations and might be more likely to be iodine deficient than women who don’t restrict salt intake . Overall, it appears that the general U.S. population has adequate iodine intake but that some pregnant women may be at risk for iodine deficiency. Continued national iodine monitoring is needed with more emphasis on population subgroups that are most susceptible to iodine deficiency disorders. Iodine Deficiency Iodine deficiency has multiple adverse effects on growth and development and is the most common cause of preventable intellectual disability in the world . Iodine deficiency disorders result from inadequate thyroid hormone production secondary to insufficient iodine . During pregnancy and early infancy, iodine deficiency can cause irreversible effects. Under normal conditions, the body tightly controls thyroid hormone concentrations via TSH. Typically, TSH secretion increases when iodine intake falls below about 100 mcg/day . TSH increases thyroidal iodine uptake from the blood and the production of thyroid hormone. However, very low iodine intakes can reduce thyroid hormone production even in the presence of elevated TSH levels. In addition, it is important to note that TSH concentration may remain within the normal range when iodine intake is low, so TSH is not a sensitive indicator of iodine deficiency . If a person’s iodine intake falls below approximately 10–20 mcg/day, hypothyroidism occurs , a condition that is frequently accompanied by goiter. Goiter is usually the earliest clinical sign of iodine deficiency . In pregnant women, iodine deficiency of this magnitude can cause major neurodevelopmental deficits and growth retardation in the fetus as well as miscarriage and stillbirth . Chronic, severe iodine deficiency in utero causes cretinism, a condition characterized by intellectual disability, deaf mutism, motor spasticity, stunted growth, delayed sexual maturation, and other physical and neurological abnormalities . In infants and children, less severe iodine deficiency can also cause neurodevelopmental deficits such as somewhat lower than average intelligence as measured by IQ . Mild to moderate maternal iodine deficiency has also been associated with an increased risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children . In adults, mild to moderate iodine deficiency can cause goiter as well as impaired mental function and work productivity secondary to hypothyroidism. Chronic iodine deficiency may be associated with an increased risk of the follicular form of thyroid cancer . Groups at Risk of Iodine Inadequacy Historically, iodine deficiency was endemic in mountainous regions of the United States and Mexico, and in the so called goiter belt around the Great Lakes . Thanks to a more national food supply, iodized salt, and other factors, overt iodine deficiency is now uncommon in North America. International efforts since the early 1990s have dramatically reduced the incidence of iodine deficiency worldwide, but some groups of people are still at risk of inadequate iodine intake. Iodine insufficiency remains a public health problem in 25 countries with a total population of about 683 million people . The following groups are among those most likely to have inadequate iodine status. People who do not use iodized salt The use of iodized salt is the most widely used strategy to control iodine deficiency. Currently, about 88% of households worldwide use iodized salt, but iodine insufficiency is still prevalent in certain regions, particularly Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Eastern Europe . Pregnant women During pregnancy, the RDA for iodine increases from 150 to 220 mcg/day . Surveys indicate that many pregnant women in the United States might consume insufficient amounts of iodine even if they do not have signs or symptoms of overt iodine deficiency . The impact, if any, of this insufficient intake on fetal development is not known. Vegans and people who eat few or no dairy products, seafood, and eggs Seafood, eggs, milk, and milk products are among the best sources of iodine. Vegans, people with certain food allergies or lactose intolerance, and others who consume no or minimal amounts of these foods might not obtain sufficient amounts of iodine . People living in regions with iodine-deficient soils Iodine-deficient soils produce crops that have low iodine levels. Mountainous areas (e.g., Himalayas, Alps, and Andes regions) and river valleys prone to flooding (especially in South and Southeast Asia) are among the most iodine-deficient regions in the world . People living in these areas are at risk of iodine deficiency unless they consume iodized salt or foods produced outside the iodine-deficient area. People with marginal iodine status who eat foods containing goitrogens Consumption of foods that contain goitrogens, substances that interfere with the uptake of iodine in the thyroid, can exacerbate iodine deficiency . Foods high in goitrogens include soy, cassava, and cruciferous vegetables (e.g., cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower). Deficiencies of iron and/or vitamin A may also be goitrogenic . These issues are of concern primarily for people living in areas prone to iodine deficiency . For most people, including most of the U.S. population, who have adequate iodine intakes and eat a variety of foods, the consumption of reasonable amounts of foods containing goitrogens is not a concern. Iodine and Health Due to its important role in fetal and infant development and thyroid hormone production, iodine is a critical nutrient for proper health at all life stages. This section focuses on four areas of biomedical research examining iodine’s role in health and disease: fetal and infant development, cognitive function during childhood, fibrocystic breast disease, and radiation-induced thyroid cancer. It also includes a section on low iodine diets, which are usually recommended for patients preparing to undergo radioactive iodine treatment. Fetal and infant development Iodine sufficiency during pregnancy is extremely important for proper fetal development. During early pregnancy, when fetal thyroid gland development is incomplete, the fetus depends entirely on maternal T4 and, therefore, on maternal iodine intake . Production of T4 increases by approximately 50% during pregnancy , requiring a concomitant increase in maternal iodine intake. Sufficient iodine intake after birth is also important for proper physical and neurological growth and maturation. Research suggests that infants are more sensitive to the effects of iodine deficiency than other age groups, as indicated by changes in their TSH and T4 levels in response to even mild iodine deficiency . Although severe iodine deficiency disorders are uncommon in the United States, mild to moderate iodine insufficiency during pregnancy may subtly affect fetal development [4,55-59]. A meta-analysis of 6,180 mother-child pairs from three birth cohorts in the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom found that verbal IQ assessed in children at 1.5 to 8 years of age was lower if their mothers had lower iodine status in their first trimester of pregnancy . To accommodate increased iodine needs during pregnancy and lactation, the iodine RDA is 220 mcg/day for pregnant women and 290 mcg/day for lactating women . Similarly, the WHO recommends 250 mcg/day during pregnancy and lactation . Despite the importance of iodine for proper fetal development, the effects of iodine supplements during pregnancy on infant and child neurodevelopment in particular are inconclusive. Two randomized clinical trials had a similar study design in which iodine was provided from early pregnancy to delivery (150 or 200 mcg/day iodine as potassium iodide) and assessed child cognition using the same tool at age 1.5 or 2 years . Iodine supplementation had no effect on child cognitive, language, or motor scores . One of these trials also assessed children at age 5–6 years and continued to find no benefit on child neurodevelopment from the mother’s use of iodine . Breast milk contains iodine, although concentrations vary based on maternal iodine levels. Infants who are exclusively breastfed depend on maternal iodine sufficiency for optimal development. In a study of 57 healthy lactating women from the Boston area, median breast milk iodine content was 155 mcg/L . Based on reported infant iodine needs and the typical volume of breast milk consumed, the authors calculated that 47% of the women may have been providing their infants breast milk containing insufficient amounts of iodine. During the weaning period, infants not receiving iodine-containing complementary foods may also be at risk of iodine deficiency, even in countries with iodized salt programs . To ensure that adequate amounts of iodine are available for proper fetal and infant development, several national and international groups recommend iodine supplementation during pregnancy, lactation, and early childhood. For women living in countries with weak, sporadic, or uneven iodized salt distribution, the WHO recommends iodine supplementation for all women of childbearing age to achieve a total iodine intake of 150 mcg/day. For pregnant and lactating women in these countries, iodine intakes of 250 mcg/day from both supplements and dietary sources are recommended . WHO recommendations for these countries also include breastfeeding through 24 months of age, combined with complementary foods fortified with iodine for children between the ages of 7–24 months . The American Thyroid Association recommends that women who are planning a pregnancy, currently pregnant, or lactating should supplement their diet with 150 mcg/day iodine in the form of potassium iodide . Similarly, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that women who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or lactating take a daily supplement providing at least 150 mcg iodine and use iodized salt . The use of iodine-containing dietary supplements by pregnant and lactating women in the United States appears to be low compared to current recommendations. Of 59 best-selling prenatal multivitamin supplements on the market in 2016–2017, only 34 contained iodine . The median iodine content was 150 mcg per daily serving, with a range of 25 to 290 mcg; 25 of the 34 provided iodine as potassium iodide. According to 2011–2014 NHANES data, 72.2% of pregnant woman took any dietary supplement, but only 17.8% of them took an iodine-containing product . Among lactating women, 75% took a dietary supplement, but only 19% of them took an iodine-containing product. Results from a 2010 study, however, raise some questions as to the safety of widespread iodine supplementation in areas of relative iodine sufficiency. In this cross-sectional study, pregnant women living in Spain had a significantly increased risk of hyperthyrotropinemia (TSH >3 microU/mL) if they consumed iodine supplements in doses ≥200 mcg/day compared with those who consumed doses <100 mcg/day . These findings suggest that taking higher doses of supplemental iodine during pregnancy could induce thyroid dysfunction in some women and underscore the need for additional research into the effects on maternal thyroid function of iodine supplementation during pregnancy. Taken as a whole, these findings indicate that increased public awareness of iodine’s importance during pregnancy and lactation is warranted and that further research into the effects of iodine supplementation during pregnancy is needed. Many researchers, as well as the American Thyroid Association, stress the importance of continued iodine status monitoring among women of reproductive age . Cognitive function during childhood The effects of severe iodine deficiency on neurological development are well documented. Results from several studies suggest, for example, that chronic, moderate to severe iodine deficiency, particularly in children, reduces IQ by about 12–13.5 points . A 2004 Cochrane Review concluded that iodine supplementation in children living in areas of iodine deficiency appears to both positively affect physical and mental development and decrease mortality with only minor and transient adverse effects . The effects of mild iodine deficiency during childhood are more difficult to quantify. Some research suggests that mild iodine deficiency is associated with subtle neurodevelopmental deficits and that iodine supplementation might improve cognitive function in mildly iodine-deficient children . In a 2009 randomized, placebo-controlled study, 184 children age 10–13 years in New Zealand with a median urinary iodine concentration of 63 mcg/L received iodine supplements (150 mcg/day) or placebo for 28 weeks . Iodine supplementation improved iodine status (median urinary iodine concentration after supplementation was 145 mcg/L) and significantly improved measures of perceptual reasoning and overall cognitive score compared with children taking a placebo. These findings suggest that correcting mild iodine deficiency in children could improve certain components of cognition. Additional research is required to fully understand the effects of mild iodine deficiency and iodine supplementation on cognitive function. Fibrocystic breast disease Fibrocystic breast disease is a benign condition characterized by lumpy, painful breasts and palpable fibrosis. It commonly affects women of reproductive age, but it can also occur during menopause, especially in women taking estrogens . Breast tissue has a high concentration of iodine, especially during pregnancy and lactation . Some research suggests that iodine supplementation might be helpful for fibrocystic breast disease, although a specific mechanism of action has not been established and data are limited. In a double-blind study, researchers randomly assigned 56 women with fibrocystic breast disease to receive daily supplements of iodine (70 to 90 mcg I2/kg body weight) or placebo for 6 months . At treatment completion, 65% of the women receiving iodine reported decreased pain compared with 33% of women in the placebo group. A more recent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial had similar findings. In this study, researchers randomly assigned 111 women (18–50 years of age) with fibrosis and a history of breast pain to receive tablets containing 0 mcg, 1,500 mcg, 3,000 mcg, or 6,000 mcg of iodine per day . After 5 months of treatment, women receiving doses of 3,000 or 6,000 mcg iodine had a significant decrease in breast pain, tenderness, and nodularity compared with those receiving placebo or 1,500 mcg iodine. The researchers also reported a dose-dependent reduction in self-assessed pain. None of the doses was associated with major adverse events or changes in thyroid function test results. Although the results of these studies are promising, more research is needed to clarify iodine’s role in fibrocystic breast disease. Moreover, the doses used in these studies (approximately 1,500–6,000 mcg per day) are several times higher than the iodine UL of 1,100 mcg for adults. Doses of this magnitude should only be used under the guidance of a physician . Radiation-induced thyroid cancer Nuclear accidents can release radioactive iodine into the environment, increasing the risk of thyroid cancer in exposed individuals, especially children . Thyroidal uptake of radioactive iodine is higher in people with iodine deficiency than in people with iodine sufficiency. For this reason, iodine-deficient individuals have a particularly high risk of developing radiation-induced thyroid cancer when exposed to radioactive iodine. FDA has approved potassium iodide as a thyroid-blocking agent to reduce the risk of thyroid cancer in radiation emergencies involving the release of radioactive iodine . FDA recommends that exposed people take a daily pharmacological dose (16–130 mg potassium iodide, depending on age) until the risk of significant radiation exposure ends . Potassium iodide was widely used in Poland following the 1986 Chernobyl accident and childhood thyroid cancer rates did not increase substantially in subsequent years . In areas where iodide prophylaxis was not used, such as Belarus and Ukraine, where many children were mildly iodine deficient, the incidence of thyroid cancer sharply increased among children and adolescents . Low iodine diets for radioactive iodine treatment Patients preparing to undergo radioactive iodine treatment for differentiated thyroid cancer are usually instructed to follow a low iodine diet prior to treatment. The rationale behind this guidance is to deplete iodine levels in the body and increase thyroidal uptake of the radioactive iodine (iodine–131) [80-82]. A low iodine diet typically limits iodine intake to 50 mcg/day or less for 1 to 2 weeks before treatment [80-83]. Specific recommendations vary, however, and research is ongoing to define optimal guidelines for low iodine diets. For example, one study in an area of the Netherlands with sufficient iodine status found that following a low iodine diet for 4 days might adequately prepare patients for radioactive iodine treatment . This study examined 24-hour urinary iodine excretion in 65 patients with differentiated thyroid cancer who followed a low iodine diet (less than 50 mcg/day) for 7 days. Iodine excretion on day 4 of the low iodine diet was not significantly different than that on day 7. However, the authors noted that following a low iodine diet for only 4 days might not be sufficient for people living in iodine-rich areas. People following a low iodine diet should avoid many foods, including iodized salt, fish and other seafood, seaweed, milk and milk products, liver, and eggs. They should also avoid bread and other grain products made with iodate dough conditioners, as well as maraschino cherries and some red or pink beverages because these products are often made with iodine-containing red dyes . Foods that are relatively low in iodine include noniodized salt (including many sea salts), fruits and fruit juices, vegetables, plant-based milk substitutes (such as soy and almond beverages), rice, pasta, oatmeal, beans, nuts, poultry, pork, beef (except liver), and bread that does not contain iodate dough conditioners. Nutrition Facts labels on foods do not usually list iodine unless the manufacturer has added iodine to the food. Therefore, Nutrition Facts labels cannot be relied upon to identify foods that naturally contain iodine, such as seaweed, fish, and other seafood. Iodine is also present in some dietary supplements, including products containing kelp and many multivitamin/mineral supplements . The Supplement Facts labels on dietary supplement products will indicate whether iodine is present and at what dose. Patients preparing for radioactive iodine treatment may develop hyponatremia, especially if they are undergoing thyroid hormone withdrawal . To reduce the risk of hyponatremia, the American Thyroid Association notes that noniodized salt use should not be restricted when following a low iodine diet . Other groups at risk for hyponatremia include people who are over 65 years of age, females, and those taking thiazide diuretics . Noniodized salt is available in grocery stores. In addition, almost all salt used in processed foods in the United States is noniodized; product labels will indicate if the manufacturer used salt that is iodized or provides iodine . The following resources may be helpful for clinicians and patients when planning low iodine diets to prepare for radioactive iodine treatment: “Low Iodine Diet” from the American Thyroid Association provides guidelines and menu options for meals and snacks. The USDA, FDA, and ODS-NIH Database for the Iodine Content of Common Foods lists the iodine content per serving and per 100-gram amounts of hundreds of foods and beverages. Includes food descriptions, as well as means, standard deviations, value ranges, sample sizes, and supporting documentation. “Thyroid Cancer Treatment” from the National Cancer Institute includes information on radioactive iodine therapy. “Childhood Thyroid Cancer Treatment” from the National Cancer Institute provides information about risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of different types of childhood thyroid cancer. “Low Iodine Diet” from the American Thyroid Association provides guidelines and menu options for meals and snacks.

Despite widespread recommendations to follow a low iodine diet prior to radioactive iodine treatment, results from studies examining the impact of this practice on treatment success are inconsistent . The authors of a 2022 systematic review and meta-analysis of 56 quantitative and 3 qualitative studies concluded that low iodine diets reduce iodine status . However, results were unclear on whether this improves the success of radioactive iodine treatment. In addition, studies have not examined whether following a low iodine diet to prepare for radioactive iodine treatment affects long-term disease recurrence or mortality . Health Risks from Excessive Iodine High intakes of iodine can cause some of the same symptoms as iodine deficiency—including goiter, elevated TSH levels, and hypothyroidism—because excess iodine in susceptible individuals inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis and thereby increases TSH stimulation, which can produce goiter . Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism can also result from high iodine intakes, including when iodine is administered to treat iodine deficiency. Studies have also shown that excessive iodine intakes cause thyroiditis and thyroid papillary cancer . Cases of acute iodine poisoning are rare and are usually caused by doses of many grams. Acute poisoning symptoms include burning of the mouth, throat, and stomach; fever; abdominal pain; nausea; vomiting; diarrhea; weak pulse; and coma . Responses to excess iodine and the doses required to cause adverse effects vary . Some people, such as those with autoimmune thyroid disease and iodine deficiency, may experience adverse effects with iodine intakes considered safe for the general population . The FNB has established iodine ULs for food and supplement intakes (Table 3). In most people, iodine intakes from foods and supplements are unlikely to exceed the UL . Long-term intakes above the UL increase the risk of adverse health effects. The ULs do not apply to individuals receiving iodine for medical treatment, but such individuals should be under the care of a physician . Table 3: Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for Iodine Birth to 6 months: Male: Not possible to establish*, Female: Not possible to establish*, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  7–12 months: Male: Not possible to establish*, Female: Not possible to establish*, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  1–3 years: Male: 200 mcg, Female: 200 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  4–8 years: Male: 300 mcg, Female: 300 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  9–13 years: Male: 600 mcg, Female: 600 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  14–18 years: Male: 900 mcg, Female: 900 mcg, Pregnancy: 900 mcg, Lactation: 900 mcg 19+ years: Male: 1,100 mcg, Female: 1,100 mcg, Pregnancy: 1,100 mcg, Lactation: 1,100 mcg * Formula and food should be the only sources of iodine for infants. Interactions with Medications Iodine supplements have the potential to interact with several types of medications. A few examples are provided below. Individuals taking these medications on a regular basis should discuss their iodine intakes with their health care providers. Antithyroid medications Antithyroid medications, such as methimazole (Tapazole), are used to treat hyperthyroidism. Taking high doses of iodine with antithyroid medications can have an additive effect and could cause hypothyroidism. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, such as benazepril (Lotensin), lisinopril (Prinivil and Zestril), and fosinopril (Monopril), are used primarily to treat high blood pressure. Taking potassium iodide with ACE inhibitors can increase the risk of hyperkalemia (elevated blood levels of potassium) . Potassium-sparing diuretics Taking potassium iodide with potassium-sparing diuretics, such as spironolactone (Aldactone) and amiloride (Midamor), can increase the risk of hyperkalemia . Iodine and Healthful Diets The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\" For more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that Includes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils.

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet. Introduction Manganese is an essential trace element that is naturally present in many foods and available as a dietary supplement. Manganese is a cofactor for many enzymes, including manganese superoxide dismutase, arginase, and pyruvate carboxylase . Through the action of these enzymes, manganese is involved in amino acid, cholesterol, glucose, and carbohydrate metabolism; reactive oxygen species scavenging; bone formation; reproduction; and immune response [3-7]. Manganese also plays a role in blood clotting and hemostasis in conjunction with vitamin K . Manganese is absorbed in the small intestine through an active transport system and, possibly, through diffusion when intakes are high . After absorption, some manganese remains free, but most is bound to transferrin, albumin, and plasma alpha-2-macroglobulin. Manganese is taken up by the liver and other tissues, but the mechanism of this process is not well understood . The human body contains about 10 to 20 mg manganese, of which 25% to 40% is in bone . The liver, pancreas, kidney, and brain also contain manganese. The body maintains stable tissue manganese concentrations through regulatory control of manganese absorption and excretion . More than 90% of absorbed manganese is excreted via bile into the feces, and a small amount is reabsorbed . Very little is excreted in urine. Manganese status is difficult to assess and not routinely measured in clinical practice. Normal whole blood concentrations of manganese range from 4 to 15 mcg/L , but they are highly variable and their utility as a status indicator is unclear . Some studies that measured serum or plasma manganese concentrations in apparently healthy adults have shown mean serum concentrations of 1.04 mcg/L and mean plasma concentrations of 1.28 mcg/L . Large variations in manganese intakes appear to affect these concentrations somewhat . However, these concentrations often do not correlate well with typical manganese intakes, so whether they are useful indicators of manganese status is not clear . Although urinary manganese concentrations decrease with severe deficiency, it is not clear whether they are useful indicators of manganese status when intakes are within the normal range . Recommended Intakes Intake recommendations for manganese and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by an expert committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine . DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include: Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects In its 2001 evaluation, the FNB found the existing data insufficient to derive an EAR for manganese. The FNB therefore established AIs for all ages based on usual manganese intakes in healthy populations . Table 1 lists the current AIs for manganese. Table 1: Adequate Intakes (AIs) for Manganese Birth to 6 months*: Male: 0.003 mg, Female: 0.003 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  7–12 months: Male: 0.6 mg, Female: 0.6 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  1–3 years: Male: 1.2 mg, Female: 1.2 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  4–8 years: Male: 1.5 mg, Female: 1.5 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  9–13 years: Male: 1.9 mg, Female: 1.6 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  14–18 years: Male: 2.2 mg, Female: 1.6 mg, Pregnancy: 2.0 mg, Lactation: 2.6 mg 19–50 years: Male: 2.3 mg, Female: 1.8 mg, Pregnancy: 2.0 mg, Lactation: 2.6 mg 51+ years: Male: 2.3 mg, Female: 1.8 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  *For infants from birth to age 6 months, the AI is based on mean manganese intakes of infants fed primarily human milk. Sources of Manganese Food Manganese is present in a wide variety of foods, including whole grains, clams, oysters, mussels, nuts, soybeans and other legumes, rice, leafy vegetables, coffee, tea, and many spices such as black pepper . Drinking water also contains small amounts of manganese at concentrations of 1 to 100 mcg/L . The top sources of manganese in the diets of U.S. adults are grain products, tea, and vegetables . Manganese concentrations are 3 to 10 mcg/L in breast milk and 30 to 100 mcg/L in cow’s milk–based infant formulas . Soy-based infant formulas have higher manganese concentrations, 200 to 300 mcg/L, than milk-based formulas . Limited research suggests that the absorption rate of manganese from human milk (8.2%) is much higher than that from soy formula (0.7%) and cow’s milk formula (3.1%) . Humans absorb only about 1% to 5% of dietary manganese . Infants and children tend to absorb greater amounts of manganese than adults . In addition, manganese absorption efficiency increases with low manganese intakes and decreases with higher intakes , but little is known about the mechanisms that control absorption . Dietary iron intakes and iron status (measured by serum ferritin concentration) appear to be inversely associated with manganese absorption . The mechanism for this effect is unknown, but the shared transporter of iron and manganese in the intestine might play a role . In addition, men appear to absorb dietary manganese less efficiently than women, possibly because men usually have higher iron status . Infants absorb higher proportions of manganese than adults; limited research shows that formula-fed infants retain about 20% of the manganese they consume . Selected food sources of manganese are listed in Table 2.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for manganese is 2.3 mg for adults and children age 4 years and older . FDA does not require food labels to list manganese content unless manganese has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA's) FoodData Central website lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides a comprehensive list of foods containing manganese ordered by nutrient content. Dietary supplements In dietary supplements, manganese is present in many different forms, including amino acid chelates (e.g., manganese bisglycinate chelate, manganese glycinate chelate, and manganese aspartate) . Other forms include manganese gluconate, manganese picolinate, manganese sulfate, manganese citrate, and manganese chloride. No data are available on the relative bioavailability of different forms of supplemental manganese. The Supplement Facts label on a dietary supplement product declares the amount of elemental manganese in the product, not the weight of the entire manganese-containing compound. Not all multivitamin/mineral supplements contain manganese, but those that do typically provide 1.0 to 4.5 mg manganese . Supplements containing only manganese, or manganese with a few other nutrients, are also available, and most contain 5 to 20 mg manganese. Many dietary supplements that contain manganese are listed in the Dietary Supplement Label Database from the National Institutes of Health . This database contains label information from tens of thousands of dietary supplement products on the market. Manganese Intakes and Status Data on manganese intakes are very limited, but they suggest that most people obtain adequate amounts of manganese. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which provides dietary intake data for most nutrients, does not include manganese . The Total Diet Study (TDS) is an FDA program that monitors the nutrient content of typical foods consumed by the U.S population . The most recent report that used TDS data to estimate dietary manganese intakes, published in 1991, used TDS data from 1982 to 1989 . According to this publication, dietary manganese intakes were 1.1 mg/day for infants age 6 to 11 months, 1.48 mg/day for children age 2 years, 1.78 to 2.76 mg/day for boys and girls age 14 to 16 years, 2.14 to 2.23 mg/day for women, and 2.64 to 2.81 mg/day for men . These values met or exceeded the manganese AI for all age groups. More recent data from a population study of 719 adults age 18 to 87 years in northern Italy show a median dietary manganese intake of 2.34 mg/day . Data on manganese intakes from dietary supplements are not currently available. Manganese Deficiency Manganese deficiency is very rare in humans, and signs and symptoms of deficiency have not been firmly established . The very limited evidence in humans suggests that manganese deficiency might cause bone demineralization and poor growth in children; skin rashes, hair depigmentation, decreased serum cholesterol, and increased alkaline phosphatase activity in men; and altered mood and increased premenstrual pain in women . Manganese deficiency might also alter lipid and carbohydrate metabolism and cause abnormal glucose tolerance . Groups at Risk of Manganese Inadequacy No known groups of people are likely to have inadequate manganese intakes. Manganese and Health Because of the role of manganese as a cofactor for several enzymes, low intakes might increase the risk of illness. This section focuses on two health areas in which manganese might be involved: bone health and diabetes. Bone health Manganese is a cofactor for several enzymes involved in bone formation . In animals, manganese deficiency can impair bone formation and reduce bone mineral density , and manganese supplementation can increase both bone mineral density and bone formation . Scientists have examined whether associations exist between circulating manganese levels, bone mineral density, and osteoporosis in humans, but the evidence is very limited and inconsistent. In one study, 10 women with osteoporosis (mean age, 69.3 years) had lower serum manganese levels (20 mcg/L) than 20 women (mean age, 64.5 years) who did not have osteoporosis (40 mcg/L) . In another study in 40 postmenopausal women, serum manganese levels were positively associated with bone mineral density and negatively associated with bone fracture rates . Conversely, a study in 77 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (median age 61 years) and 61 postmenopausal women without osteoporosis (median age 60 years) found no differences in red blood cell manganese levels (14.76 mcg/L for women with osteoporosis vs. 15.54 mcg/L for women without osteoporosis) or plasma manganese levels (5.34 mcg/L for women with osteoporosis vs. 5.09 mcg/L for women without osteoporosis) . In addition, no associations between plasma manganese levels and bone mineral density were observed in a study of 90 men age 50 to 80 years . No clinical trials have evaluated the effects of manganese supplementation alone on bone health. In one small clinical trial, supplementation with calcium (1,000 mg) plus trace minerals (5 mg manganese, 15 mg zinc, and 2.5 mg copper) for 2 years improved spinal bone density compared with placebo in 59 healthy postmenopausal women (mean age 66 years) . However, it is not possible to determine to what extent, if any, the manganese alone affected bone density. More research is needed to determine whether manganese supplementation affects bone health in humans. Diabetes As a cofactor for several enzymes, manganese is involved in glucose, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism, and manganese deficiency might affect carbohydrate metabolism and cause abnormalities in glucose tolerance . Therefore, scientists have examined whether manganese status affects the risk of diabetes. Several studies have found associations between both increased and decreased [32-34] blood levels of manganese and the prevalence of type 2 diabetes . For example, in a case-control study in China of 122 adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes and 429 adults without diabetes (age range for all participants was 40–92 years), those in the highest tertile of plasma manganese (>2.42 mcg/L) were 7.88 times more likely to have diabetes than those in the lowest tertile (<1.67 mcg/L) . Conversely, in a case-control study in Sardinia of 192 adults with type 1 diabetes (mean age 48.8 years), 68 adults with type 2 diabetes (mean age 68.4 years), and 59 adults without diabetes (mean age 57.2 years), median blood concentrations of manganese were lower in those with either type 1 (8.62 mcg/L) or type 2 diabetes (10.7 mcg/L) than in those who did not have diabetes (14.2 mcg/L) . A large case-control study in China suggested a U-shaped association between plasma manganese levels and type 2 diabetes . This study included 1,614 adults with type 2 diabetes (mean age 52.5 years) and 1,614 adults without diabetes (mean age 54.7 years). Compared with the middle tertile of plasma manganese concentration (4.21–6.84 mcg/L), those in the lowest tertile (≤4.21 mcg/L) were 1.89 times more likely, and those in the highest tertile (≥6.84 mcg/L) were 1.56 times more likely, to have type 2 diabetes. Other studies have found no associations between blood manganese levels and diabetes prevalence . Research in animals suggests that manganese supplementation might improve glucose tolerance, reduce oxidative stress, and improve endothelial dysfunction in diabetes , but clinical trials in humans are lacking. More research is needed to determine whether manganese plays any role in the development of diabetes. Health Risks from Excessive Manganese No evidence shows manganese toxicity from high dietary manganese intakes . However, manganese toxicity has occurred in people working in such occupations as welding and mining who were exposed to high amounts of manganese from chronic inhalation of manganese dust . People who consume water containing high levels of manganese (in some cases as high as 28 mg/L) have also developed manganese toxicity . Manganese toxicity mainly affects the central nervous system and can cause tremors, muscle spasms, tinnitus, hearing loss, and the feeling of being unsteady on one’s feet . Additional symptoms include mania, insomnia, depression, delusions, anorexia, headaches, irritability, lower extremity weakness, changes in mood and short-term memory, altered reaction times, and reduced hand-eye coordination . These signs and symptoms can progress to neuromotor impairments similar to those associated with Parkinson’s disease, including changes in gait and balance, tremor, and rigidity . Iron deficiency increases manganese absorption and can therefore exacerbate symptoms of manganese toxicity . People with chronic liver disease have impaired manganese elimination in bile and are more susceptible to manganese neurotoxicity and other adverse effects of excess manganese intakes . The FNB established manganese ULs for healthy individuals based on levels associated with whole-blood manganese concentrations above the normal range of 4 to 15 mcg/L and risk of neurotoxicity . The ULs do not apply to individuals who are taking supplemental manganese under medical supervision.

Interactions with Medications Manganese is not known to have any clinically relevant interactions with medications.

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet. Introduction Copper, an essential mineral, is naturally present in some foods and is available as a dietary supplement. It is a cofactor for several enzymes (known as cuproenzymes) involved in energy production, iron metabolism, neuropeptide activation, connective tissue synthesis, and neurotransmitter synthesis [1-3]. One abundant cuproenzyme is ceruloplasmin (CP), which plays a role in iron metabolism and carries more than 95% of the total copper in healthy human plasma . Copper is also involved in many physiologic processes, such as angiogenesis; neurohormone homeostasis; and regulation of gene expression, brain development, pigmentation, and immune system functioning . In addition, defense against oxidative damage depends mainly on the copper-containing superoxide dismutases . A wide variety of plant and animal foods contain copper, and the average human diet provides approximately 1,400 mcg/day for men and 1,100 mcg/day for women that is primarily absorbed in the upper small intestine [1,2,7-9]. Almost two-thirds of the body’s copper is located in the skeleton and muscle . Only small amounts of copper are typically stored in the body, and the average adult has a total body content of 50–120 mg copper . Most copper is excreted in bile, and a small amount is excreted in urine. Total fecal losses of copper of biliary origin and nonabsorbed dietary copper are about 1 mg/day . Copper levels in the body are homeostatically maintained by copper absorption from the intestine and copper release by the liver into bile to provide protection from copper deficiency and toxicity . Copper status is not routinely assessed in clinical practice, and no biomarkers that accurately and reliably assess copper status have been identified . Human studies typically measure copper and cuproenzyme activity in plasma and blood cells because individuals with known copper deficiency often have low blood levels of copper and CP . However, plasma CP and copper levels can be influenced by other factors, such as estrogen status, pregnancy, infection, inflammation, and some cancers . Normal serum concentrations are 10–25 mcmol/L (63.5–158.9 mcg/dL) for copper and 180–400 mg/L for CP . Recommended Intakes Intake recommendations for copper and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine . DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following: Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects Table 1 lists the current RDAs for copper . For infants from birth to 12 months, the FNB established an AI for copper that is equivalent to the mean intake of copper in healthy, breastfed infants. Table 1: Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for Copper Birth to 6 months*: Male: 200 mcg, Female: 200 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  7–12 months*: Male: 220 mcg, Female: 220 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  1–3 years: Male: 340 mcg, Female: 340 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  4–8 years: Male: 440 mcg, Female: 440 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  9–13 years: Male: 700 mcg, Female: 700 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  14–18 years: Male: 890 mcg, Female: 890 mcg, Pregnancy: 1,000 mcg, Lactation: 1,300 mcg 19+ years: Male: 900 mcg, Female: 900 mcg, Pregnancy: 1,000 mcg, Lactation: 1,300 mcg Sources of Copper Food The richest dietary copper sources include shellfish, seeds and nuts, organ meats, wheat-bran cereals, whole-grain products, and chocolate . The absorption of copper is strongly influenced by the amount of copper in the diet; bioavailability ranges from 75% of dietary copper when the diet contains only 400 mcg/day to 12% when the diet contains 7.5 mg/day . Tap water and other beverages can also be sources of copper, although the amount of copper in these liquids varies by source (ranging from 0.0005 mg/L to 1 mg/L) . Several food sources of copper are listed in Table 2.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for copper is 0.9 mg (900 mcg) for adults and children age 4 years and older . FDA does not require food labels to list copper content unless copper has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) FoodData Central lists the nutrient content of many foods. Dietary supplements Copper is available in dietary supplements containing only copper, in supplements containing copper in combination with other ingredients, and in many multivitamin/mineral products . These supplements contain many different forms of copper, including cupric oxide, cupric sulfate, copper amino acid chelates, and copper gluconate. To date, no studies have compared the bioavailability of copper from these and other forms . The amount of copper in dietary supplements typically ranges from a few micrograms to 15 mg (about 17 times the DV for copper) . Copper Intakes and Status Typical diets in the United States meet or exceed the copper RDA. Mean dietary intakes of copper from foods range from 800 to 1,000 mcg per day for children age 2–19 . In adults age 20 and older, average daily intakes of copper from food are 1,400 mcg for men and 1,100 mcg for women. Total intakes from supplements and foods are 900 to 1,100 mcg/day for children and 1,400 to 1,700 mcg/day for adults age 20 and over. According to an analysis of data from the 2009–2012 National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES), 6% to 15% of adults age 19 and older who do not take dietary supplements containing copper have copper intakes below the EAR . In those who do use supplements, rates of adults with intakes below the copper EAR range from 2.2% to 7.2%. Copper Deficiency Copper deficiency is uncommon in humans . Based on studies in animals and humans, the effects of copper deficiency include anemia, hypopigmentation, hypercholesterolemia, connective tissue disorders, osteoporosis and other bone defects, abnormal lipid metabolism, ataxia, and increased risk of infection . Groups at Risk of Copper Inadequacy The following groups are most likely to have inadequate copper status. People with celiac disease In a study of 200 adults and children with celiac disease, of which 69.9% claimed to maintain a gluten-free diet, 15% had copper deficiency (less than 70 mcg/dL in serum in men and girls younger than 12 years and less than 80 mcg/dL in women older than 12 years and/or CP less than 170 mg/L) as a result of intestinal malabsorption resulting from the intestinal lining alterations associated with celiac disease . In its 2009 clinical guidelines for celiac disease, the American College of Gastroenterology notes that people with celiac disease appear to have an increased risk of copper deficiency and that copper levels normalize within a month of adequate copper supplementation while eating a gluten-free diet . People with Menkes disease Menkes disease is a rare, X-linked, recessive disorder of copper homeostasis caused by ATP7A mutations, which encode a copper-transporting ATPase . In these individuals, intestinal absorption of dietary copper drops sharply, leading to signs of copper deficiency, including low serum copper and CP levels . The typical manifestations of Menkes disease include failure to thrive, impaired cognitive development, aortic aneurysms, seizures, and unusually kinky hair . Most individuals with Menkes disease die by age 3 years if untreated, but subcutaneous injections of copper starting in the first few weeks after birth can reduce mortality risk and improve development . People taking high doses of zinc supplements High dietary intakes of zinc can interfere with copper absorption, and excessive use of zinc supplements can lead to copper deficiency. Reductions in erythrocyte copper-zinc superoxide dismutase, a marker of copper status, have been reported with even moderately high zinc intakes of approximately 60 mg/day for up to 10 weeks . People who regularly consume high doses of zinc from supplements or use excessive amounts of zinc-containing denture creams can develop copper deficiency because zinc can inhibit copper absorption. This is one reason the FNB established the UL for zinc at 40 mg/day for adults . Copper and Health This section focuses on two diseases in which copper might play a role: cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer’s disease. Cardiovascular disease Copper deficiency leads to changes in blood lipid levels, a risk factor for atherosclerotic CVD . Animal studies have shown that copper deficiency is associated with cardiac abnormalities, possibly because of the resulting decreases in the activity of several cardiac cuproenzymes . However, observational studies of the link between copper concentrations and CVD have had mixed results. A representative cohort study of 1,197 asymptomatic adults age 45 to 64 in Italy assessed the effects of self-reported copper intakes on various metabolic markers, including markers of atherosclerotic disease risk (diastolic blood pressure, total and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] levels) . Diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol levels were significantly lower in the highest tertile of copper intake (2.29 mg/day) compared with the lowest tertile (1.12 mg/day). In contrast, an analysis of 1976–1992 data on 4,574 participants in the second NHANES found that the risk of death from coronary heart disease was 2.87 times higher for participants age 30 and older in the fourth quartile for serum copper concentration (137 mcg/dL or higher) than for those in the first quartile (less than 106 mcg/dL) . Similarly, an analysis of data on 3,253 adults with acute coronary syndromes (mean age 62 years in the 70% who were male and 65 years in the 30% who were female) in a cardiovascular health study in Germany found higher hazard ratios—2.58 for copper and 3.02 for CP concentrations in serum—for death from CVD in the highest (mean 147 mcg/dL for copper, 38.3 mg/dL for CP) versus the lowest (81.6 mcg/dL for copper, 22.9 mg/dL for CP) quartiles . A few small studies that assessed the impact of copper supplementation in healthy adults have found little evidence that supplementation affects CVD risk factors. For example, daily supplementation with 2 mg copper as copper glycinate for 8 weeks in 70 healthy adults age 45 to 60 years increased the activity of two cuproenzymes, erythrocyte superoxide dismutase 1 and plasma CP, but had no effect on five other CVD-related plasma markers (CRP, homocysteine, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol) . In 16 healthy women (mean age 24 years), daily supplementation with 3 mg or 6 mg elemental copper as copper sulfate had no significant effect on CVD risk factors, including total plasma cholesterol or triacylglycerol concentrations . However, the concentration of fibrinolytic factor PAI-I decreased by about 30% (indicating reduced CVD risk) with 6 mg/day copper supplementation compared with placebo. No clinical trials of copper supplementation have been conducted in people with increased CVD risk. Overall, the evidence to date is insufficient to support any conclusions about the association between copper concentrations and CVD risk or the impact of copper supplementation on CVD. Alzheimer’s disease Some experts believe that dietary copper deficiency plays a role in the etiology and pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease, the leading cause of dementia, because of several reports of low copper levels and low activity of copper-dependent enzymes in the brains of people with the disease . Limited evidence shows that people with higher copper levels have a lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease . However, high levels of copper have also been found in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease, and some researchers argue that excess amounts of dietary copper are involved in the development of this disease . Furthermore, copper accumulation in damaged brain regions in Alzheimer’s disease might not directly reflect overall body copper status or copper intakes . A few observational studies have assessed the relationship between dietary copper levels and Alzheimer’s disease, with mixed results. One study, for example, assessed cognitive function using four cognitive tests during home visits every 3 years for 6 years and intakes of copper and saturated and trans fats using a food frequency questionnaire in 3,718 community-dwelling (noninstitutionalized) adults age 65 and older . In the overall study population, dietary and total copper intakes were not associated with cognitive decline. However, in 604 participants (16.2%) who consumed a diet higher in saturated and trans fat, total copper intake in the highest quintile (median 2.75 mg/day) was associated with a significantly faster rate of cognitive decline compared with the lowest intake quintile (median 0.88 mg/day). In contrast, an analysis of data on 1,112 adults older than 60 years found no differences in serum copper or CP levels between patients with Alzheimer’s disease (n=211) and healthy controls (n=695) . This study did reveal, however, a significant decline in serum copper not bound to CP in patients with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease compared with the healthy control group 18 months after baseline. Meta-analyses have found that people with Alzheimer’s disease tend to have higher serum copper levels than adults without the disease. In a meta-analysis of 10 studies in 867 healthy individuals and 599 with Alzheimer’s disease (mean age greater than 70 years in both groups), patients with Alzheimer’s disease had significantly higher serum levels of copper not bound to CP and total serum copper than healthy controls . In an earlier meta-analysis of 26 studies in a total of 1,058 patients with Alzheimer’s disease and 932 controls, those with Alzheimer’s disease had significantly higher levels of serum copper than the healthy controls . Very little clinical evidence is available on the impact of copper supplementation in patients with Alzheimer’s disease. One clinical trial that randomly assigned 68 patients age 50 to 80 years with mild Alzheimer’s disease to supplementation with 8 mg copper daily or placebo for 12 months found no significant differences in cognition between groups . Experts participating in the 2013 International Conference on Nutrition and the Brain suggested that individuals at increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease using multivitamin/mineral supplements choose those that have no copper (or iron) because excessive intakes of these minerals could contribute to cognitive issues in some patients . However, much more research is needed to determine whether high or low levels of serum or plasma copper are associated with Alzheimer’s disease risk and whether supplements containing copper could affect Alzheimer’s disease risk or symptoms. Health Risks from Excessive Copper Chronic exposure to high levels of copper can result in liver damage and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., abdominal pain, cramps, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting) . Copper toxicity is rare in healthy individuals who do not have a hereditary copper homeostasis defect. However, copper toxicity has been reported in people who consume water containing high levels of copper as a result of stagnant water in copper-containing pipes and fixtures as well as copper alloys in water distribution systems and household plumbing that allow copper to leach into water . The Environmental Protection Agency has established a recommended upper limit for copper in public water systems of 1.3 mg/L . People with Wilson’s disease, a rare, autosomal recessive disease, have a high risk of copper toxicity. Wilson’s disease, which is caused by a mutation in ATP7B, leads to abnormally high tissue levels of copper as a result of defective copper clearance . People with this disease can develop neurologic and liver damage that can result in cirrhosis . Patients can also develop acute hepatitis, hemolytic crisis, and liver failure. Lifelong copper chelation therapy or high doses of zinc can prevent permanent organ damage in these patients. The FNB has established ULs for copper from food and supplements for healthy individuals based on levels associated with liver damage . The ULs do not apply to individuals who are receiving supplemental copper under medical supervision.

Interactions with Copper Copper is not known to have any clinically relevant interactions with medications. Copper and Healthful Diets The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\" For more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that Includes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils.

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet. Introduction Selenium is an essential mineral that is naturally present in many foods and added to others. It is also available as a dietary supplement. Selenium is a constituent of 25 selenoproteins, including thioredoxin reductases, glutathione peroxidases, and selenoprotein P . Selenoproteins play critical roles in thyroid hormone metabolism, DNA synthesis, reproduction, and protection from oxidative damage and infection [2-4]. Soil and ground water contain inorganic forms of selenium (e.g., selenites and selenates) that plants accumulate and convert to organic forms, mostly selenomethionine and selenocysteine and their methylated derivatives. In foods, selenium is present primarily as selenomethionine along with selenocysteine. Dietary selenium is readily absorbed by the body and absorption is largely not affected by selenium status [4-6]. Absorbed selenomethionine and inorganic selenium is rapidly metabolized to a common intermediate that is used for synthesizing selenocysteine, the form of selenium found in the 25 human selenoproteins. Approximately 28% to 46% of the total body’s selenium content is found in skeletal muscle . Selenium homeostasis is maintained primarily by urinary excretion and, in cases of higher selenium intake, through the lungs and feces . The most commonly used measures of selenium status are plasma and serum selenium concentrations . Plasma or serum selenium concentrations of 8 micrograms (mcg)/dL or higher in healthy people are considered sufficient for selenoprotein synthesis . Concentrations in plasma, serum, and urine reflect recent selenium intake whereas selenium concentrations in whole blood (including erythrocytes) indicate long term status. Analyses of hair and nail selenium content are also used to monitor long term intakes, over months or years . The two predominant selenoproteins in plasma are glutathione peroxidase 3 and selenoprotein P, and both can be used as functional biomarkers of selenium status . However, some experts question the reliability of these two biomarkers to indicate selenium deficiency because plasma selenoprotein concentrations can be affected by inflammation and oxidative stress . In addition, research suggests that selenium supplementation does not increase selenoprotein P concentration and glutathione peroxidase activity unless individuals are selenium deficient . Urinary methylated selenometabolites are not reliable selenium status biomarkers because many people lack the methylation enzymes due to genetic polymorphisms . Recommended Intakes Intake recommendations for selenium and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine . DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following: Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects Table 1 lists the current RDAs for selenium in mcg. For infants from birth to 12 months, the FNB established an AI for selenium that is equivalent to the mean intake of selenium in healthy, breastfed infants. Table 1: Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for Selenium Birth to 6 months: Male: 15 mcg*, Female: 15 mcg*, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  7–12 months: Male: 20 mcg*, Female: 20 mcg*, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  1–3 years: Male: 20 mcg, Female: 20 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  4–8 years: Male: 30 mcg, Female: 30 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  9–13 years: Male: 40 mcg, Female: 40 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  14–18 years: Male: 55 mcg, Female: 55 mcg, Pregnancy: 60 mcg, Lactation: 70 mcg 19–50 years: Male: 55 mcg, Female: 55 mcg, Pregnancy: 60 mcg, Lactation: 70 mcg 51+ years: Male: 55 mcg, Female: 55 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  *Adequate Intake (AI) Sources of Selenium Because selenium in foods is protein bound, foods that are high in protein tend to be the best sources of selenium. Brazil nuts, seafood, meat, poultry, and organ meats are the richest food sources of selenium. Other sources include cereals and other grains, and dairy products . The amount of selenium in drinking water is not nutritionally significant in most geographic regions . The major food sources of selenium in the diets of people in the United States are breads, grains, meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs . The amount of selenium in a given type of plant-based food depends on the amount and form of selenium in the soil and several other factors, such as soil pH and amount of organic matter in the soil . As a result, selenium concentrations in plant-based foods vary widely by geographic location . For example, according to FoodData Central from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Brazil nuts have an average of 544 mcg selenium/ounce, but values from other analyses vary widely [16-18]. The selenium content of soil affects the amount of selenium in the plants that animals eat. However, this does not substantially affect the amount of selenium in animal products because animals maintain predictable tissue concentrations of selenium through homeostatic mechanisms . Furthermore, formulated livestock feeds generally contain selenium at consistent levels . Several food sources of selenium are listed in Table 2.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for selenium is 55 mcg for adults and children age 4 years and older . FDA does not require food labels to list selenium content unless selenium has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet. USDA’s FoodData Central lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides a comprehensive list of foods containing selenium arranged by nutrient content and by food name. Dietary Supplements Selenium is available in multivitamin/mineral supplements, in supplements containing vitamin E and other ingredients, and as stand-alone supplements. Common forms include selenomethionine, selenium-enriched yeast (grown in a high-selenium medium, predominantly as selenomethionine), sodium selenite, and sodium selenate [21-23]. Doses of selenium in multivitamin/mineral supplements vary, but many contain 55 mcg. The amount of selenium is often higher in supplements with fewer ingredients. For example, supplements that combine selenium with vitamin E or other ingredients generally contain 50 to 200 mcg of selenium. Selenium-only supplements typically contain 100 to 400 mcg . The human body absorbs up to about 90% of selenium from selenomethionine, selenium-enriched yeast, selenite, and selenate [4-6,9,12,24]. Selenium Intakes and Status Most people in the United States consume adequate amounts of selenium. In addition,17% to 19% of adults use a dietary supplement containing selenium . According to an analysis of data from the 2017–March 2020 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the average daily selenium intake in people age 2 years and older from foods and beverages is 108 mcg and from foods, beverages, and supplements is 116 mcg . Adult men have higher daily intakes (132 mcg from foods and beverages and 145 mcg from foods, beverages, and supplements) than adult women (94 mcg from foods and beverages and 102 mcg from foods, beverages, and supplements). Dietary selenium intakes are similar among people who are Black and those who are White. People who follow a vegetarian or vegan dietary pattern may have lower selenium intakes than others [26-28]. According to an analysis of NHANES data from 2011 to 2016, the mean serum selenium concentration in males and females age 8 to 80 years is 12.7 mcg/dL . Research indicates that men have slightly higher serum selenium concentrations than women, and people who are White have higher concentrations than those who are Black [30-33]. Selenium status is lower in people who smoke, possibly because smoking increases oxidative stress . Selenium intakes and serum concentrations in the United States and Canada vary somewhat by region because of differences in the amounts of selenium in soil and in local foods consumed . For example, residents of the Midwestern and Western United States have higher concentrations than those living in the South and Northeast . However, the extensive transport of food in the United States typically allows people living in low-selenium areas to obtain sufficient amounts of selenium . Selenium Deficiency Selenium deficiency alone rarely causes overt illness, but it produces biochemical changes that might predispose people who experience additional stresses to develop certain illnesses . For example, Keshan disease is an endemic cardiomyopathy that was first identified in 1935 in parts of China where the soil is low in selenium. Adults in these areas had average selenium intakes of no more than 10 mcg/day whereas intakes of at least 20 mcg/day protect adults from the disease . Keshan disease mainly affects women of childbearing age and preschool children. Although prevalence is low today, the disease still exists . The etiology of Keshan disease remains unknown, but disease incidence dramatically reduced following several large intervention trials in the 1970s to 1990s that provided selenium selenite supplements. A 2018 systematic review and meta-analysis of 41 studies found that selenium supplements (doses not indicated) reduce the risk of Keshan Disease by 86% . Selenium deficiency is also associated with Kashin-Beck disease, a type of osteoarthritis that commonly presents in childhood and puberty and occurs in certain low-selenium and low-iodine areas of China, Tibet, Siberia, and North Korea . Selenium deficiency could exacerbate iodine deficiency, potentially increasing the risk of congenital hypothyroidism in infants . Endemic myxedematous hypothyroidism is a disease that occurs in regions with very low selenium levels, such as Central Africa, and is thought to develop during gestation or early childhood. Individuals with this condition produce insufficient thyroid hormone and present with very low plasma triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) levels and extremely high thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels . Groups at Risk of Selenium Inadequacy Selenium deficiency is very rare in the United States and Canada . However, some people, including those living in certain other countries, may obtain insufficient amounts of selenium. The following groups are among those most likely to have inadequate intakes of selenium. People living in selenium-deficient regions Selenium intakes in North America, even in low-selenium regions, are well above the RDA , likely because most people consume foods originating from a wide geographic area. However, people in some countries whose diet consists primarily of vegetables grown in low-selenium areas are at risk of deficiency . The lowest selenium intakes in the world are in certain parts of China, where large proportions of the population have a primarily vegetarian diet and soil selenium levels are very low . Average selenium intakes are also low in some European countries, especially among populations consuming vegan diets . Although intakes in New Zealand were low in the past, they rose after the country increased its importation of high-selenium wheat . People undergoing kidney dialysis Selenium concentrations are often significantly lower in patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis than in healthy individuals partly because hemodialysis removes some selenium from the blood [43-46]. In addition, hemodialysis patients are at risk of low dietary selenium intakes due to anorexia resulting from uremia and dietary restrictions . However, whether selenium concentrations are sufficient in hemodialysis patients also depends on individual selenium status. For example, median selenium concentrations were above the 95th percentile of normal (normal reference: median 9.2 mcg/dL) at baseline and remained elevated in a 2-year prospective cohort study of 198 hemodialysis patients in Western Canada . Although selenium supplementation increases blood concentrations in hemodialysis patients, more evidence is needed to determine whether supplements have beneficial clinical effects in these individuals. People living with HIV People living with HIV often have low selenium concentrations, possibly due to malabsorption or inadequate selenium intakes . The prevalence of selenium deficiency in people living with HIV varies by country, reflecting variable selenium content of the soil . Observational studies have found an association between lower selenium concentrations in people with HIV and an increased risk of cardiomyopathy; worsening of disease progression; death; and, in pregnant women, HIV transmission to offspring and early death of offspring [50-54]. However, randomized trials suggest selenium supplementation has little effect on HIV disease progression or treatment. Selenium and Health This section focuses on six diseases and conditions in which selenium might play a role: cancer, cardiovascular disease, cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease, HIV infection, male fertility, and thyroid disease. Cancer Because of its effects on DNA repair, apoptosis, and the endocrine and immune systems as well as other mechanisms, including its antioxidant properties, selenium has been hypothesized to play a role in the prevention of cancer [15,55-57]. Results from animal studies also suggest that selenium may have chemopreventive properties . Researchers have examined the effects of selenium primarily for prostate, breast, lung, and colorectal cancers, with prostate cancer being the most extensively studied. Epidemiological studies have suggested an inverse association between selenium status and the risk of colorectal, prostate, lung, bladder, skin, esophageal, and gastric cancers. In addition, a few early clinical trials found that selenium supplements reduced the risk of some forms of cancer, but more recent trials have not supported these findings . The Nutritional Prevention of Cancer Trial, which began recruitment in 1983, was a randomized controlled trial that investigated 200 mcg/day selenium as selenium yeast or placebo for a mean of 4.5 years in 1,312 men and women in the United States with histories of nonmelanoma skin cancer . Although selenium supplementation did not reduce the recurrence of nonmelanoma skin cancer, a secondary analysis of the trial found that men who took selenium had a 49% lower risk of prostate cancer than those who took placebo over a mean follow-up of about 7.5 years. The effect was strongest among men with the lowest baseline plasma selenium concentrations (below 10.6 mcg/dL), with no effect among men with plasma selenium concentrations greater than 12.3 mcg/dL. The subsequent Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT), however, did not find that selenium supplementation reduced the risk of prostate cancer. This randomized, controlled trial in 35,533 men age 50 years or older from the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico was discontinued after 5.5 years when analyses showed no association between prostate cancer risk and supplementation with 200 mcg/day selenium as selenomethionine with or without 400 international units (IU)/day vitamin E . An additional 1.5 years of follow-up data on participants after they stopped taking the study supplements confirmed the lack of a significant association between selenium supplementation and prostate cancer risk . Further investigation in a case-cohort of 1,739 men diagnosed with prostate cancer and 3,117 matched controls from the SELECT trial found that selenium supplementation did not affect prostate cancer risk in men with low baseline selenium status (based on toenail selenium levels) . However, the researchers did find an increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer in men with higher baseline selenium status (≥ 60th percentile of toenail selenium) and recommended that men over age 55 avoid selenium supplementation at doses that exceed recommended dietary intakes. A 2018 Cochrane Review on selenium for the prevention of cancer included 83 studies (including the studies described above) . Among the 70 observational cohort studies reviewed, participants with the highest baseline selenium status had a 28% lower cancer risk and a 24% lower cancer mortality than those with the lowest status. In addition, these participants had a 33% lower risk of bladder cancer; an 18% lower risk of lung cancer; an 18% lower risk of colorectal cancer; and, in men, a 16% lower risk of prostate cancer. The authors found no association between selenium status in women and risk of breast cancer. However, due to major weaknesses in study design, confounders, and limitations in the assessment of selenium exposure, the certainty of evidence for these findings was very low. In addition, no evidence of a dose-response relationship between selenium status and cancer risk was observed. The 10 randomized, placebo-controlled trials examined in the 2018 Cochrane Review included a total of 27,232 participants, 94% of which were men . Results from these studies showed that supplementing with 200 to 500 mcg/day selenium, primarily as selenomethionine, for 2 to 10.3 years had little to no effect on cancer incidence or mortality. The certainty of evidence was high for prostate, colorectal, lung, and bladder cancers and moderate for breast and nonmelanoma skin cancers. Because most of the studies used 200 mcg/day selenium, the authors concluded that 200 mcg/day selenium does not reduce the overall risk of cancer or the risk of individual cancer types. They also concluded that more research is needed to determine if selenium supplementation might modify cancer risk in individuals with specific genetic backgrounds or nutritional status or if different forms of selenium have different effects . Starting in 2003, FDA allowed two qualified health claims that some scientific evidence suggests consumption of selenium “may reduce the risk of certain forms of cancer” and “may produce anticarcinogenic effects.” However, FDA determined that this evidence is limited and not conclusive . In 2009, FDA evaluated additional qualified health claims for selenium and denied claims for many forms of cancer but allowed qualified health claims for three forms of cancer, noting that FDA concludes it is “highly uncertain” that selenium supplements reduce the risk of bladder cancer in women or the risk of thyroid cancer, and “highly unlikely” that selenium supplements reduce the risk of prostate cancer . More research is needed to fully understand the relationship between selenium status and cancer risk and to determine whether selenium supplements can help prevent any form of cancer. Cardiovascular disease Selenoproteins help reduce inflammation and prevent lipid oxidation and platelet aggregation . For these reasons, experts have hypothesized that selenium supplements could reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease or deaths associated with cardiovascular disease. Results from early observational studies suggested that low selenium status might increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. A 2006 meta-analysis of 25 observational studies primarily in men over age 40 reported an inverse association between selenium concentrations and risk of coronary heart disease . Mean serum selenium concentrations ranged from 5.18 to 13.07 mcg/dL; men with the highest selenium concentrations had a 15% lower risk of coronary heart disease than those with the lowest. Since then, epidemiological studies on the role of selenium in cardiovascular disease have yielded conflicting findings. A study in 1,042 middle-age White men and women (mean age 40.8 years) reported that higher plasma selenium concentrations (mean 12.4 mcg/dL) were associated with higher total and non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels . On the other hand, a study in 13,887 adults in the United States showed no association between baseline serum selenium concentrations (mean 12.56 mcg/dL) and cardiovascular mortality over 12 years of follow-up . Similarly, an 18-year prospective study in 3,112 young adult men and women (age 20–32 years at baseline) reported no association between baseline toenail selenium levels and changes in carotid intima-media thickness or coronary artery calcium score at the end of the study . Several clinical trials have examined whether selenium supplementation alone or as part of a multivitamin/mineral supplement reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease. In one trial, 474 healthy adults age 60 to 74 years with a mean baseline plasma selenium concentration of 9.12 mcg/dL took 100, 200, or 300 mcg/day selenium as selenium yeast or placebo for 6 months . Selenium supplements providing 100 and 200 mcg/day lowered total plasma cholesterol an average of 8.5 and 9.7 mg/dL and non-HDL cholesterol by 7.7 and 10.4 mg/dL, respectively, while 300 mcg/day selenium increased HDL levels by 2.3 mg/dL. However, the study authors noted that the clinical significance of these findings is unclear. Other trials have found that supplementation with selenium alone (100, 200, or 300 mcg/day) or supplementation with a multivitamin/mineral product containing selenium (100 mcg/day) does not reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease or cardiac death [67,74-76]. The SELECT trial (detailed in the Cancer section, above) assessed cardiovascular risk as a secondary outcome in 17,488 well-nourished men and found no effect of 200 mcg/day selenium on risk of cardiovascular events over 7 to12 years, compared with placebo . A Cochrane Review of SELECT and 11 other smaller randomized trials providing 100 to 800 mcg/day selenium supplementation for 2 weeks to 12 years in a total of 19,715 predominantly male adults also found that selenium supplements did not reduce the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events . All studies were assessed as having a low risk of bias. Although studies suggest that supplementing with selenium does not reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, including selenium in antioxidant mixtures may reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality. A meta-analysis and systematic review included 43 randomized trials in adults who took either selenium supplements alone or as part of antioxidant formulas for at least 24 weeks (antioxidant formulas were defined by the researchers as containing two or more of the following: selenium, retinol, beta-carotene, vitamin C, vitamin E, zinc, or copper) . Selenium alone, providing 100 to 400 mcg/day, or antioxidant formulas with or without 50 to 200 mcg selenium were not associated with cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular mortality, compared with placebo. However, when the antioxidant formula trials were separated into selenium-containing or not, cardiovascular mortality was reduced by 23% in participants taking the antioxidant formulas containing selenium, compared with those who took antioxidant formulas that did not contain selenium. Overall, clinical trial evidence does not support the use of selenium supplementation for reducing the risk of heart disease, particularly in healthy people who obtain sufficient selenium from food. Additional clinical trials are needed to better understand any contributions of selenium from food and dietary supplements to cardiovascular health. Cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease Selenoproteins have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, and serum selenium concentrations decline with age . In addition, chronic selenium deficiencies are correlated with cognitive decline . For these reasons, researchers have hypothesized that higher selenium intakes might reduce the risk of cognitive decline. An analysis of 2011–2014 NHANES data showed that higher whole blood selenium concentrations and higher selenium intakes were associated with higher cognitive scores in older adults . However, results from other observational studies have been mixed [83-86]. A study in 1,012 men and women in Italy (mean age 75 years) reported that lower plasma selenium concentrations were associated with subtle neurological impairments . Participants in the lowest quartile of plasma selenium (less than 6.67 mcg/dL) had worse neuro-motor performance than those in the highest quartile (more than 8.23 mcg/dL). In contrast, a study in 154 healthy people in Australia (96% women, average age 71 years), 85% of whom had replete selenium concentrations (average plasma selenium 16.9 mcg/dL), found no association between plasma selenium concentrations and cognitive outcomes . Researchers have evaluated whether taking an antioxidant supplement containing selenium reduces the risk of cognitive impairment in older adults. A post hoc analysis of the Supplémentation en Vitamines et Minéraux Antioxydants (SU.VI.MAX) study in 4,447 participants age 45 to 60 years in France found that, compared with placebo, people who took a daily supplement containing 100 mcg selenium with 120 mg ascorbic acid, 30 mg vitamin E, 6 mg beta-carotene, and 20 mg zinc for 8 years had higher episodic memory and semantic fluency test scores 6 years after supplementation ended . However, selenium’s independent contribution to the observed effects in this study cannot be determined. Observational studies have found that individuals with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have lower blood selenium concentrations compared with cognitively healthy older adults . The Prevention of Alzheimer’s Disease with Vitamin E and Selenium (PREADVISE) trial was the first large-scale primary prevention trial to study the effects of selenium (200 mcg/day as selenomethionine) and vitamin E (400 IU/day) in 7,540 cognitively healthy men age 60 years and older . However, during the 5.4 years of supplement use, the trial found no difference in the incidence of new AD or dementia among participants taking selenium only, vitamin E only, or selenium plus vitamin E, compared with placebo. A 2022 systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 clinical trials evaluated the effects of supplements containing selenium only or selenium plus other nutrients in adults age 69 to 89 years with mild cognitive impairment or AD . Supplements containing both organic and inorganic forms of selenium were used. Results from these studies showed that selenium-only supplements at various doses and selenium plus other nutrient supplements for 12 to 24 weeks did not improve cognitive test scores. Selenium may play a role in maintaining healthy brain function, but clinical evidence does not support the use of selenium supplementation in replete individuals for reducing the risk of cognitive decline and dementia in older adults. HIV infection In children and adults with HIV, selenium deficiency is associated with a higher risk of morbidity and mortality . However, studies examining whether micronutrient supplementation, including selenium, affects risk of HIV transmission or disease outcomes in children and adults have had mixed results. An observational study in Thailand did not identify associations between selenium status in children with HIV and treatment outcomes . This study included 141 boys and girls with HIV (median age 7.3 years), 97 of whom started antiretroviral therapy (ART) over a period of 48 weeks. Baseline selenium concentrations (all of which were adequate) showed no associations with ART treatment outcomes. Clinical trials have found limited benefits of selenium supplementation on immune function in people with HIV. A clinical trial in Rwanda examined the effects of selenium supplementation on CD4+ T-cell counts in 300 men and women age 21 years and older with HIV . Participants had CD4+ T-cell counts between 400 and 650 cells/mcL, so they were not yet eligible for ART and they took 200 mcg/day selenium or placebo for 24 months. During the trial, average CD4+ T-cell counts declined in both the treatment and placebo groups, but the rate of depletion was 43.8% lower in those who took selenium. However, selenium supplementation had no effect on the composite endpoint of a CD4+ count less than 350 cells/mcL or initiation of ART. Selenium supplementation provided no benefits in a randomized controlled trial in Iran in which 146 men and women receiving ART for HIV (mean age 38.6 years) took 50 mg/day zinc, 200 mcg/day selenium, or placebo for 6 months. The investigators then followed participants for another 3 months but found that selenium supplementation did not raise CD4+ T-cell counts . Two Cochrane Reviews also concluded that selenium supplements offer little, if any, benefit for people with HIV. The first review examined whether micronutrient supplementation reduces the burden of HIV infection in children . It included 3 clinical trials that administered 30 or 60 mcg/day selenium as part of a multiple-micronutrient formulation in children with HIV who were living in South Africa or Uganda. The authors found that evidence was insufficient to determine whether supplementation with selenium alone is beneficial. Similarly, the authors of a second Cochrane Review of 4 clinical trials in a total of 1,187 adults with HIV concluded that 200 mcg/day selenium for 9 to 24 months may have little to no effect on CD4+ T-cell count and viral load . They also concluded the evidence was insufficient to determine whether selenium supplementation affects the risk of hospital admission in adults with HIV. Researchers have also examined whether blood selenium concentration or selenium supplementation affects pregnancy outcomes in women with HIV. These studies have found associations between low blood selenium concentrations and higher risk of preterm birth, and they suggest that selenium supplementation might reduce the risk of preterm birth. For example, a cross-sectional study in Nigeria of 113 pregnant adolescents and women age 15 to 49 years with HIV found that those with a selenium deficiency (defined as blood selenium less than 7 mcg/dL) at 14 to 26 weeks of gestation were almost eight times as likely to have a preterm birth as those with normal selenium concentrations . Individuals with a low CD4+ T-cell count also had an eight-fold higher risk of preterm birth. In a clinical trial in Nigeria, researchers examined whether selenium supplementation affected pregnancy outcomes and disease progression in 90 pregnant women with HIV (mean age 29.7 years) at 14 to 27 weeks of gestation . In this trial, participants took 200 mcg/day selenium or placebo between enrollment and delivery. Those who took selenium had a 68% lower risk of preterm birth than those who took placebo, but the risk of low birthweight did not differ between the two groups. In addition, selenium supplementation did not affect the levels of HIV infection markers (CD4+ T-cell counts and viral load). Overall, clinical evidence on whether selenium supplementation affects risk of HIV transmission or disease outcomes is inconclusive, although limited evidence suggests that it might reduce the risk of preterm birth in women with HIV. More research is needed to determine whether selenium supplementation benefits children and adults with HIV. Male fertility Infertility is considered a global public health issue, affecting about 15% of the world’s population. Observational studies suggest that consuming a healthy diet may improve sperm quality . Certain nutrients, such as selenium, may also play a role, possibly because they reduce oxidative stress that has been linked to male infertility. In addition, the selenoprotein phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase is a major constituent and structural component of mature sperm . A 5-year prospective study in idiopathic infertile men found that both low and high selenium semen concentrations were associated with male infertility and reproductive failures . Clinical trials evaluating selenium supplementation on sperm quality have had conflicting findings. A trial in 54 healthy men (nonsmokers) age 18 to 45 years administered 300 mcg/day selenium (as selenium yeast) or placebo for 48 weeks . No differences in sperm concentration or motility were found between groups, and semen volume declined in both groups. In contrast, a 3-month trial in Scotland in 69 men (mean age 33 years) with reduced sperm motility and low selenium plasma concentrations (mean 8.1 mcg/dL) found that 100 mcg/day selenium as selenomethionine improved plasma selenium concentrations, sperm motility, and chance of conception compared with placebo. No additional benefits were found when vitamins A, C, and E were included with the selenium supplement . Another 3-month trial that provided 200 mcg/day selenium as selenium yeast or 200 mg/day coenzyme Q10 to 70 men (average age 25 years) with idiopathic infertility reported increases in total and progressive sperm motility in those taking selenium . However, this trial did not have a placebo group or measure baseline selenium status. More research is needed to determine whether selenium supplements affect male fertility. Thyroid disease Selenium concentration is higher in the thyroid gland than in any other organ in the body and, like iodine, selenium has important functions in thyroid hormone synthesis and metabolism . For example, selenoproteins play critical roles in the conversion of the prohormone T4 to the active T3. In addition, the selenoproteins glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase help protect the thyroid gland from the hydrogen peroxide produced during thyroid hormone synthesis . Epidemiological studies have found associations between low selenium status and increased risk of thyroid disease. However, this effect has been observed only in women . For example, data from 1,900 middle-age men and women with mean serum selenium concentrations of 12.4 mcg/dL showed an inverse association between serum selenium concentrations and thyroid volume and a protective effect of selenium against risk of goiter in the women participants, but not the men . A cross-sectional study in 805 women age 18 to 65 and men age 60 to 65 years in Denmark with mean serum selenium concentrations of 9.7 mcg/dL and mild iodine deficiency also found an inverse association between serum selenium concentration and thyroid volume in the women only . A randomized trial administered 100, 200, or 300 mcg/day selenium as selenium yeast for 6 months in 368 healthy men and women age 60 to 74 years with mean baseline plasma selenium concentrations of 9.13 mcg/dL. It reported no effect on thyroid function, even though plasma selenium concentrations increased in all three groups . Chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT), also called Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, affects 1 to 2 percent of the population, particularly middle-age females . Several clinical trials have investigated the effect of selenium supplementation on thyroid antibodies in people with AIT. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 16 trials assessed the effects of selenium supplementation on serum thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) and thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) levels in those with AIT who were treated with levothyroxine compared with those newly diagnosed and not treated with levothyroxine . The trials included a total 1,494 adults (mainly women) who were administered 80 to 200 mcg/day selenium (as selenomethionine or sodium selenite) for 3 to 12 months and all but two trials were placebo controlled. Five trials reported baseline serum selenium concentrations ranging from 3.7 to 8.5 mcg/dL, indicating deficient to marginal selenium status in many participants; the other trials did not report baseline selenium status. In the levothyroxine-treated groups, selenium supplementation lowered TPOAb levels. In addition, selenomethionine was more effective than sodium selenite at lowering TPOAb, possibly because of higher absorption. In the levothyroxine-untreated groups of newly diagnosed participants, selenium supplementation lowered TPOAb and TgAb levels in the 3-month studies but not in the 6- or 12-month studies. Other trials have evaluated the effects of selenium supplementation on thyroid function and quality of life in adults with AIT. A systematic review included 9 controlled trials (all of which were included in the 16-study review described above) in 679 predominantly female participants (mean age approximately 39–48 years) . Some of the trials also administered levothyroxine, but analyses were limited to trials using selenium alone. Results showed that selenium supplementation ranging from 80 to 200 mcg/day as selenomethionine or sodium selenite for 3 to 12 months did not affect TSH levels, thyroid echogenicity (ultrasound, a measure of hypothyroidism), or health-related quality of life. As in the above-mentioned review, participants had deficient to marginal selenium status in seven of the nine trials that reported on status. The authors concluded that the evidence does not support the use of selenium supplementation for AIT. Up to 50% of pregnant women who are TPOAb or TgAb positive in the first trimester will develop postpartum thyroiditis, and 20% to 40% of these women will develop permanent primary hypothyroidism . However, results have been mixed from clinical trials examining the effects of selenium supplementation in this population. In one trial, 151 pregnant White women age 18 to 36 years who were TPOAb positive with normal thyroid function and marginal selenium status (mean 8.09 mcg/dL) took 200 mcg/day selenium as selenomethionine or placebo from 12.5 weeks of gestation through 12 months postpartum . Of the participants in the selenium group, 28.6% developed postpartum thyroid disorders compared with 48.6% of those in the placebo group. In addition, 11.7% of participants in the selenium group developed permanent hypothyroidism compared with 20.3% in the placebo group. Another trial provided 83 mcg/day selenium as selenomethionine to 45 pregnant women who were TPOAb and/or TgAb positive. It also reported reductions in these antibodies at 6 months postpartum compared with placebo . However, a trial that provided 60 mcg/day selenium as selenium yeast to TPOAb positive pregnant women who were mild to moderately iodine deficient showed no reduction in TPOAb levels at delivery . In 2017, the American Thyroid Association issued a weak recommendation against the use of selenium supplementation for pregnant women who are TPOAb positive based on moderate quality evidence . Although selenium is involved with normal thyroid function, more research is needed to understand the role of selenium supplements in thyroid disease, particularly by gender and selenium status. Health Risks from Excessive Selenium Chronically high intakes of the organic and inorganic forms of selenium have similar effects . Early indicators of excess intake are a garlic odor in the breath and a metallic taste in the mouth. The most common clinical signs of chronically high selenium intakes, or selenosis, are hair loss and nail brittleness or loss. Other signs and symptoms include skin rash, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, irritability, and nervous system abnormalities . As discussed earlier, Brazil nuts contain very high amounts of selenium (68–91 mcg per nut) and could cause selenium toxicity if consumed regularly. Acute selenium toxicity has resulted from the ingestion of misformulated over-the-counter products containing very large amounts of selenium . In 2008, for example, 201 people experienced severe adverse reactions from taking a liquid dietary supplement containing 200 times the labeled amount of selenium . Acute selenium toxicity can cause severe gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms; acute respiratory distress syndrome; myocardial infarction; hair loss; muscle tenderness; tremors; lightheadedness; facial flushing; kidney failure; cardiac failure; and, in rare cases, death . The FNB has established ULs for selenium from food and supplements based on the amounts of selenium that are associated with hair and nail brittleness and loss (see Table 3) . These ULs, however, do not apply to people taking selenium under the care of a physician. Table 3: Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for Selenium Birth to 6 months: Male: 45 mcg, Female: 45 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  7–12 months: Male: 60 mcg, Female: 60 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  1–3 years: Male: 90 mcg, Female: 90 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  4–8 years: Male: 150 mcg, Female: 150 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  9–13 years: Male: 280 mcg, Female: 280 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  14–18 years: Male: 400 mcg, Female: 400 mcg, Pregnancy: 400 mcg, Lactation: 400 mcg 19+ years: Male: 400 mcg, Female: 400 mcg, Pregnancy: 400 mcg, Lactation: 400 mcg In 2023, the Panel on Nutrition, Novel Foods and Food Allergens of the European Food Safety Authority released a scientific opinion on the ULs for selenium . Based on systematic reviews that examined associations between excess selenium intake and clinical effects, specifically alopecia, the panel set an upper limit for selenium of 255 mcg/day for all adults, including women who are pregnant or lactating, with lower amounts ranging from 70 to 230 mcg/day for children and teens, depending on age. Interactions with Medications Selenium can interact with certain medications, and some medications can have an adverse effect on selenium levels. One example is provided below. Individuals taking this and other medications on a regular basis should discuss their selenium status with their health care providers. Cisplatin Cisplatin, an inorganic platinum chemotherapy agent, is used to treat ovarian, bladder, lung, and other cancers. Cisplatin can reduce selenium levels in hair and serum but whether these reductions have a clinically significant impact is not known . Some small studies have shown that selenium supplementation can reduce cisplatin’s toxicity , but the authors of a Cochrane Review concluded that the evidence that selenium supplementation alleviates the side effects of chemotherapy is insufficient . Selenium and Healthful Diets The federal government’s 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that “Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. … In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).” For more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA’s MyPlate. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that Includes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils.

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet. Introduction Chromium, as trivalent (+3) chromium, is a trace element that is naturally present in many foods and available as a dietary supplement. Chromium also exists as hexavalent (+6) chromium, a toxic by-product of stainless steel and other manufacturing processes . This fact sheet focuses entirely on trivalent chromium. Chromium might play a role in carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism by potentiating insulin action [1-5]. Although the precise mechanism for this activity has not been identified, scientists have proposed that chromium binds to an oligopeptide to form chromodulin, a low-molecular-weight, chromium-binding substance that binds to and activates the insulin receptor to promote insulin action [4,6-8]. Chromium might also have antioxidant effects . In 2001, the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine considered chromium to be an essential nutrient based on its effects on insulin action . However, recent research has suggested that although chromium might have benefits at pharmacologic amounts (e.g., in the hundreds of mcg), it is not an essential mineral because an absence or deficiency of chromium does not produce abnormalities that can be reversed with the addition of chromium (see the Chromium Deficiency section below) [5,9-13]. The FNB has not evaluated chromium since 2001. However, in 2014, the European Food Safety Authority Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies concluded that no convincing evidence shows that chromium is an essential nutrient and, therefore, setting chromium intake recommendations would be inappropriate . In the blood, most chromium is bound to plasma proteins, particularly transferrin, and only about 5% is unbound . Chromium accumulates mainly in the liver, spleen, soft tissue, and bone . Chromium is excreted mainly in the urine . Urinary chromium levels are therefore a good indicator of chromium absorption. However, because these levels are closely related to recent chromium intakes, they are not good indicators of chromium body stores . Hair levels might reflect past chromium intakes , and some studies have measured chromium levels in hair, sweat, serum, and toenails . However, no validated methods for determining chromium status and no clinically defined chromium deficiency state exist . Recommended Intakes Intake recommendations for chromium and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by an expert committee of the FNB at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine . DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following: Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects In its 2001 evaluation, the FNB found the existing data insufficient to derive an EAR for chromium. The FNB therefore established AIs for all ages based on usual chromium intakes in healthy populations . Table 1 lists the current AIs for chromium. Table 1: Adequate Intakes (AIs) for Chromium Birth to 6 months*: Male: 0.2 mcg, Female: 0.2 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  7–12 months*: Male: 5.5 mcg, Female: 5.5 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  1–3 years: Male: 11 mcg, Female: 11 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  4–8 years: Male: 15 mcg, Female: 15 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  9–13 years: Male: 25 mcg, Female: 21 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  14–18 years: Male: 35 mcg, Female: 24 mcg, Pregnancy: 29 mcg, Lactation: 44 mcg 19–50 years: Male: 35 mcg, Female: 25 mcg, Pregnancy: 30 mcg, Lactation: 45 mcg 51+ years: Male: 30 mcg, Female: 20 mcg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  Sources of Chromium Food Chromium is present in many foods, including meats, grain products, fruits, vegetables, nuts, spices, brewer’s yeast, beer, and wine. However, chromium amounts in these foods vary widely depending on local soil and water conditions as well as agricultural and manufacturing processes used to produce them [4,7,12,17-20]. For example, the amount of chromium can vary 50-fold in samples of oatmeal because of growing and processing differences . Some chromium can also be transferred to foods from stainless steel equipment during food processing and from pots and pans during cooking . Most dairy products and foods high in sugar (e.g., sucrose and fructose) are low in chromium . Human milk contains about 0.25 mcg/L chromium , but reported values vary widely. Small studies in Europe found chromium concentrations ranging from 0.14 to 10.8 mcg/L . Dietary chromium absorption is low, ranging from about 0.4% to 2.5% . Ascorbic acid and prostaglandin inhibitors, such as aspirin, increase chromium absorption, whereas oxalate and antacids inhibit it . A variety of types of foods and their chromium levels per serving are listed in Table 2. Determining the chromium content of food is challenging because samples are easily contaminated by standard tools used for measurement and analysis . Therefore, the values in Table 2 should only serve as a guide.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for chromium is 35 mcg for adults and children age 4 and older . FDA does not require food labels to list chromium content unless chromium has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet. Dietary supplements Most multivitamin/mineral supplements contain chromium, typically 35–120 mcg. Supplements containing only chromium are also available, and they commonly provide 200 mcg to 500 mcg chromium, although some contain up to 1,000 mcg . Dietary supplements contain many forms of chromium, including chromium picolinate, chromium nicotinate, chromium polynicotinate, chromium chloride, and chromium histidinate . The absorption of various forms of chromium is similar . For example, research suggests that the proportion of chromium absorbed from chromium picolinate is about 1.2%, whereas that from chromium chloride is about 0.4% . These values are similar to the proportion of chromium absorbed from food . Chromium compounds contain various percentages of elemental chromium. For example, elemental chromium accounts for 12.4% of the weight of chromium picolinate . The Supplement Facts label on a dietary supplement product declares the amount of elemental chromium, not the weight of the entire chromium compound, in the product. Chromium Intakes and Status The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) provides dietary intake data for many nutrients, but not chromium . Therefore, data on chromium intakes in the United States are limited. A small study in eight men and 11 women in the United States found mean chromium intakes of about 29 mcg/day for women and 54 mcg/day for men . In another study, the mean chromium content per 2,000 kcal of 22 well-balanced diets designed by nutritionists was about 27 mcg and ranged from about 17 to 47 mcg . These findings suggest that most people in the United States have chromium intakes similar to the AIs. A 2018 dietary intake assessment in Northern Italy found that the median chromium intake was about 57 mcg/day from a typical Italian diet . Data on chromium intakes from dietary supplements are also very limited. According to an analysis of NHANES III (1988–1994) data, the median supplemental intake of chromium was about 23 mcg/day among those taking supplements containing chromium . Chromium Deficiency Chromium deficiency has not been reported in healthy populations, and no definitive deficiency symptoms have been established . In three case studies published in the 1970s and 1980s, patients on long-term total parenteral nutrition (TPN) experienced adverse metabolic and neurological effects, including hyperglycemia, glycosuria, unexplained weight loss, peripheral neuropathy, glucose intolerance, and/or confusion [32-34]. These effects were alleviated with pharmacologic amounts of chromium. Although these adverse effects were presumed to be caused by chromium deficiency, the studies did not adequately evaluate the chromium concentrations in the TPN solutions . Scientists have concluded, based on recent evaluations, that these studies do not provide evidence that the patients had chromium deficiency and thus do not demonstrate that heathy people can develop chromium deficiency . Currently, chromium is routinely added to TPN solutions to provide 10–15 mcg chromium per day, a much higher daily amount than the approximately 0.15 mcg/day that healthy individuals absorb from a balanced diet . Thus, the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition and other experts recommend research on parenteral chromium requirements to determine whether chromium levels in TPN solutions should be lowered . Chromium and Health This section focuses on five conditions in which chromium might have beneficial effects: impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes, metabolic syndrome, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), dyslipidemia, and weight and lean body mass. Impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes Because chromium might potentiate the action of insulin, studies have examined whether increasing chromium intakes might reduce the risk of impaired glucose tolerance. Numerous randomized controlled trials have assessed the effects of chromium supplements–often at pharmacological doses (e.g., in the hundreds of mcg)–in people without diabetes or with glucose intolerance or diabetes . One of the most commonly cited intervention studies of the effects of chromium supplementation for type 2 diabetes was a 1997 randomized controlled trial . The trial assigned 180 adults age 35–65 years with type 2 diabetes to receive 100 mcg chromium (as chromium picolinate), 500 mcg chromium, or placebo twice daily for 4 months. At both 2 and 4 months, participants receiving 1,000 mcg/day chromium had significantly lower fasting serum glucose concentrations than those receiving placebo or 200 mcg/day chromium. At 4 months, for example, mean fasting serum glucose levels were 7.1 mmol/L (128 mg/dL) in the group receiving 1,000 mcg/day chromium and 8.8 mmol/L (159 mg/dL) in those receiving placebo. Mean serum glucose concentrations after a 75 g glucose challenge were also significantly lower at both 2 and 4 months in those receiving 1,000 mcg/day chromium (10.5 mmol/L [189 mg/dL] at 4 months vs. 12.3 mmol/L [222 mg/dL] for placebo). In comparison with placebo, both 200 mcg and 1,000 mcg/day chromium also significantly reduced fasting insulin concentrations at both 2 and 4 months, as well as insulin concentrations after a glucose challenge. Finally, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels were significantly lower after 4 months in participants receiving 200 mcg/day chromium (mean 7.5%) or 1,000 mcg/day chromium (mean 6.6%) than in those receiving placebo (mean 8.5%). HbA1c is a robust measure of blood glucose control because it reflects long-term changes in blood glucose levels . Several subsequent studies that used various doses of chromium had inconsistent findings. A 2019 review of chromium and glycemic control included eight meta-analyses and systematic reviews of a total of 58 clinical trials . The trials lasted from 3 weeks to 6 months and administered 1.28 to 1,000 mcg chromium daily. The most frequently used form was chromium picolinate, followed by yeasts containing chromium and chromium chloride. Overall, when used as an adjuvant treatment, chromium lowered fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c levels slightly in people with diabetes. However, the clinical significance of these findings is unclear. The authors of a 2016 review of chromium supplementation in people with type 2 diabetes drew similar conclusions, noting the insufficient rationale to recommend chromium supplements for people with type 2 diabetes and that chromium supplements do not help moderate glucose levels in healthy individuals . Some research suggests that responses to chromium supplementation may vary, and supplements might be more likely to benefit people with more severe insulin resistance and poorer glycemic control . In a randomized trial in 137 participants age 30–70 years with type 2 diabetes, daily supplementation with 1,000 mcg chromium (as chromium picolinate) for 24 weeks did not significantly affect insulin sensitivity, fasting glucose levels, or HbA1c values in comparison with placebo . However, some participants did respond to chromium supplementation, and these people had significantly lower insulin sensitivity (3.98 vs. 5.91 mg/kg fat-free mass/min) and higher fasting glucose (8.5 vs. 6.7 mmol/L [153 vs. 121 mg/dL]) and HbA1c levels (7.57 vs. 6.29%) than those who did not respond. Manufacturers market chromium supplements widely in the United States for people with type 2 diabetes, and many adults use them in the hope that the supplements will reduce their risk of diabetes or improve their glycemic control . However, FDA allows only the following qualified health claim for chromium picolinate dietary supplements: In its 2010 diabetes guidelines, the American Diabetes Association concluded that because studies have not definitively shown that chromium supplementation benefits people with diabetes or obesity, the association cannot recommend such supplementation . This determination was based on conflicting evidence from poorly controlled or uncontrolled studies. Similarly, the association concluded in its 2015 position statement that evidence is insufficient to support the routine use of supplements containing chromium and other micronutrients for glycemic control in people with diabetes . Additional research is needed to determine whether specific populations (e.g., ethnic background, obesity status, baseline insulin sensitivity, and medication use) might be more likely than others to benefit from chromium supplementation . Metabolic syndrome Metabolic syndrome is a group of risk factors—abdominal obesity, high triglyceride level, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL; good) cholesterol level, hypertension, and high fasting blood glucose level—that raise the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and stroke . Insulin resistance is an integral component of this condition and is a potential therapeutic target for dietary interventions for metabolic syndrome . A prospective study of 3,648 adults age 20–32 years found that baseline toenail chromium concentrations were inversely associated with the incidence of metabolic syndrome over 23 years of follow-up . For these reasons, some scientists have hypothesized that chromium supplements might benefit people with metabolic syndrome. Only a few clinical trials of chromium supplementation for metabolic syndrome have been conducted [46,48-50]. One of these trials included 63 adults age 18 to 75 years with metabolic syndrome who received either 500 mcg chromium picolinate or placebo twice daily for 16 weeks . In comparison with placebo, chromium supplementation significantly increased acute insulin response to glucose but did not affect HbA1c levels, insulin sensitivity, or other measures of glucose metabolism. Chromium supplementation also had no effect on body weight or serum lipids. Similarly, in a 2018 clinical trial of 70 adults (mean age 58 years) with metabolic syndrome and impaired glucose tolerance, daily supplementation with 300 mcg chromium (200 mcg with breakfast and 100 mcg with dinner, as chromium yeast) for 24 weeks did not affect fasting glucose levels, HbA1c, waist circumference, blood pressure, or lipid levels . Overall, limited research suggests that chromium supplements do not significantly benefit people with metabolic syndrome. Polycystic ovary syndrome PCOS is a common endocrine disorder affecting women of reproductive age. It is characterized by infertility, obesity, dyslipidemia, hyperandrogenism, and elevated risks of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease . Because insulin resistance is often a central component of PCOS, studies have investigated the use of chromium supplements in people with PCOS to help maintain glycemic control and reduce lipid levels . Four recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials have examined the effects of chromium supplements on signs and symptoms of PCOS [52,54-56]. One analysis included seven trials with a total of 351 participants that administered chromium (as chromium picolinate) at 200 mcg to 1,000 mcg daily for 8 to 24 weeks . Chromium supplementation had no effect on fasting blood glucose, total testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, or luteinizing hormone levels. However, chromium did significantly reduce body mass index (BMI) by 2.37 kg/m2 and free testosterone levels by 0.52 pg/mL in comparison with placebo; it also significantly reduced fasting insulin levels by 0.33 milli-IU/mL. Another systematic review and meta-analysis of five randomized trials lasting 8 weeks to 6 months that included a total of 268 women with PCOS compared supplemental chromium (200−1,000 mcg/d, mostly as chromium picolinate) with placebo or metformin . Chromium supplementation had no significant effect on fasting insulin levels or insulin sensitivity, but data from two trials showed that it did significantly lower a measure of insulin resistance. In addition, one trial included in the review found that chromium supplementation significantly improved a measure of beta-cell function. The authors concluded that the magnitude of chromium’s effect was small and of uncertain clinical relevance. Similarly, another meta-analysis and a systematic review had mixed findings . Overall, the evidence on whether chromium supplementation reduces the risk of PCOS or is beneficial for women with this condition is mixed, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions . Additional studies with sufficient samples sizes and duration in well-defined populations are needed . Dyslipidemia Numerous studies show associations between poor chromium status and elevated blood cholesterol levels . Therefore, scientists hypothesize that chromium supplementation might improve blood lipid levels. Studies have examined this possibility in various populations, including people with impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes, or PCOS. In a randomized clinical trial in 71 participants (mean age 54.1 years) with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (HbA1c of at least 7%), supplementation with 600 mcg/day chromium picolinate for 4 months had no effect on total cholesterol, HDL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL; bad) cholesterol, or triglyceride levels in comparison with placebo . However, an 8-week trial in 40 women with PCOS age 18–40 years found that 200 mcg/day chromium as chromium picolinate significantly decreased serum triglycerides in comparison with placebo (–19.2 vs. +8.3 mg/dL) and total cholesterol levels (–15.3 vs. –0.6 mg/dL) . Results of studies with higher doses of supplemental chromium have also been mixed . Overall, meta-analyses examining the effects of chromium supplementation in people with diabetes [60-64] and PCOS have shown no significant changes in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels . However, some have shown that chromium supplementation increases HDL cholesterol levels by 1.73–4.64 mg/dL and decreases triglyceride levels by 11.71–26.57 mg/dL . Additional research is needed to determine whether chromium supplementation has any clinically significant effects on dyslipidemia. Weight and lean body mass Because chromium might amplify insulin action, some scientists have proposed that chromium supplementation could reduce the amount of glucose converted to fat and increase protein synthesis and, hence, muscle mass . Some preliminary research also indicates that chromium supplements might reduce food intakes, hunger levels, and fat cravings . Therefore, chromium supplementation has been proposed to both enhance weight loss and improve body composition by decreasing body fat and increasing lean body mass; its effects on these outcomes have been evaluated in several clinical trials [12,66-69]. A 2019 meta-analysis included 21 trials that measured the impact of chromium supplementation on anthropometric indexes in a total of 1,316 participants age 18 or older with overweight or obesity . Trial durations ranged from 9 to 24 weeks, and chromium doses were 200 to 1,000 mcg per day. Most trials used chromium picolinate, and others used chromium-enriched yeast or chromium nicotinate. Participants taking chromium supplements lost significantly more weight, 0.75 kg, than those taking placebo and had a significant 0.40 kg/m2 reduction in BMI and body fat percentage, 0.68%, in comparison with placebo. The chromium supplements had no significant effect on waist circumference or waist-to-hip ratio. Two other systematic reviews and meta-analyses had similar findings , as did a 2013 Cochrane Review . The Cochrane Review’s authors noted that the effect of chromium supplementation on body weight is of “debatable clinical relevance” and the overall quality of the evidence is low. Overall, research suggests that supplementation with chromium, mainly in the form chromium picolinate, reduces body weight and body fat percentage to a very small, but statistically significant, extent. However, these effects have little clinical significance. Health Risks from Excessive Chromium The FNB concluded that no adverse effects have been linked to high intakes of chromium from food or supplements, so it did not establish a UL for chromium . However, the FNB noted that caution may be warranted because the data are limited and that high intakes of chromium could have adverse effects . The FNB also pointed out that people with renal and liver disease might be susceptible to adverse effects from high chromium intakes . According to isolated case reports, chromium supplements might cause weight loss, anemia, thrombocytopenia, liver dysfunction, renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, dermatitis, and hypoglycemia . Interactions with Medications Several types of medications have the potential to interact with chromium supplements. A few examples are provided below. People taking these and other medications on a regular basis should discuss their chromium intakes with their health care providers. Insulin Chromium might increase insulin sensitivity . Taking chromium concomitantly with insulin could increase the risk of hypoglycemia . Metformin and other antidiabetes medications The results from some studies indicate that chromium supplementation might lower blood glucose levels . Therefore, chromium supplements might have an additive effect with metformin or other antidiabetes medications and thus might increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Levothyroxine A small study found that taking chromium picolinate supplements at the same time as levothyroxine (used to treat hypothyroidism) decreases levothyroxine absorption over 6 hours . Chromium and Healthful Diets The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\" For more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's MyPlate. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that Includes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils. Many whole grains, fruits, and vegetables are good sources of chromium.

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet. Introduction Molybdenum is an essential trace element that is naturally present in many foods and is also available as a dietary supplement. Molybdenum is a structural constituent of molybdopterin, a cofactor synthesized by the body and required for the function of four enzymes: sulfite oxidase, xanthine oxidase, aldehyde oxidase, and mitochondrial amidoxime reducing component (mARC). These enzymes metabolize sulfur-containing amino acids and heterocyclic compounds including purines and pyrimidines . Xanthine oxidase, aldehyde oxidase, and mARC are also involved in metabolizing drugs and toxins [3-6]. Molybdenum appears to be absorbed via a passive nonmediated process, though where absorption occurs in the intestinal tract is not known . Adults absorb 40% to 100% of dietary molybdenum [2,7-10]. Infants absorb almost all of the molybdenum in breast milk or formula . The kidneys are the main regulators of molybdenum levels in the body and are responsible for its excretion . Molybdenum, in the form of molybdopterin, is stored in the liver, kidney, adrenal glands, and bone . Because molybdenum deficiency is rare , molybdenum status is not assessed in clinical settings. According to a small study of 30 healthy men and women, serum levels of molybdenum range from 0.28 ng/mL to 1.17 ng/mL, and their average is 0.58 ng/mL . In another small study of four healthy young men, plasma levels of molybdenum reached 6.22 ng/mL with a molybdenum intake of 1,490 mcg per day for 24 days . The average concentration of urinary molybdenum is 69 ng/mL, but urinary molybdenum does not reflect molybdenum status . Recommended Intakes Intake recommendations for molybdenum and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine . DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following: Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects The basis for the EAR for molybdenum consists of two carefully controlled balance studies in a total of eight young men. The EAR for children and adolescents is extrapolated from adult values. Table 1 lists the current RDAs for molybdenum .

Other foods high in molybdenum include whole grains, nuts, and beef liver . The top sources of molybdenum in U.S. diets are legumes, cereal grains, leafy vegetables, beef liver, and milk . Milk and cheese products are the main sources of molybdenum for teens and children . The amount of molybdenum in food depends on the amount of molybdenum in the soil and in the water used for irrigation . Drinking water generally contains only small amounts of molybdenum . However, according to 2017 data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 0.8% of drinking water samples had molybdenum levels above 40 mcg/L . The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) FoodData Central does not list the molybdenum content of foods or provide lists of foods containing molybdenum. Therefore, the amount of information on molybdenum levels in foods is quite limited.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for molybdenum is 45 mcg for adults and children age 4 years and older . FDA does not require food labels to list molybdenum content unless molybdenum has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet. Dietary supplements Molybdenum is available in dietary supplements containing molybdenum only, in combination with other minerals, and in multivitamin/mineral products. Amounts range from about 50 mcg to 500 mcg. Forms of molybdenum in dietary supplements include molybdenum chloride, sodium molybdate, molybdenum glycinate, and molybdenum amino acid chelate . No studies have compared the relative bioavailability of molybdenum from these different forms. Molybdenum Intakes and Status Most Americans appear to consume adequate amounts of molybdenum. Although national surveys no longer collect data about molybdenum intake, FDA’s 1984 Total Diet Study estimated that average daily molybdenum intakes from foods were 109 mcg in men and 76 mcg in women . According to the 1988–1994 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, molybdenum intakes from dietary supplements averaged 23 mcg/day for men and 24 mcg/day for women . Intakes of molybdenum from drinking water collected from the 100 largest cities in the United States are estimated to be about 3 mcg/day based on intakes of 2 liters of water per day . Molybdenum Deficiency Molybdenum deficiency has not been reported, except in people with a genetic mutation that prevents the synthesis of molybdopterin and therefore of sulfite oxidase . In this rare metabolic disorder, known as molybdenum cofactor deficiency, mutations in one of several genes prevent the biosynthesis of molybdopterin. The absence of molybdopterin impairs the function of enzymes that metabolize sulfite, leading to encephalopathy and seizures [1,14,27-29]; the neurological damage is severe and usually leads to death within days after birth . A single reported incident of acquired molybdenum deficiency occurred in 1981 in a patient receiving total parenteral nutrition that was devoid of molybdenum. The patient developed tachycardia, tachypnea, headache, night blindness, and coma. These effects resolved with molybdenum administration . Groups at Risk of Molybdenum Inadequacy No known groups of people are likely to have inadequate molybdenum intakes. Molybdenum and Health Molybdenum is not a standard treatment for any disease or disorder. Health Risks from Excessive Molybdenum Acute molybdenum toxicity is rare, but it can occur with industrial mining and metalworking exposure. In healthy people, consumption of a diet high in molybdenum usually does not pose a health risk because the molybdenum is rapidly excreted in urine . One study assessed the effect of high dietary intakes of molybdenum (10–15 mg/day) in an area of Armenia where the soil contains very high levels of molybdenum. The affected individuals experienced achy joints, gout-like symptoms, and abnormally high blood levels of uric acid . Given the absence of human studies, the FNB established ULs for molybdenum for healthy individuals based on levels associated with impaired reproduction and fetal development in rats and mice .

Interactions with Medications Molybdenum has no known, clinically relevant, interactions with medications. Molybdenum and Healthful Diets The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\" For more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate.

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet. Introduction Boron is a trace element that is naturally present in many foods and available as a dietary supplement. It is a structural component of plant cell walls and is required for plant growth, pollination, and seed formation . Boron is not classified as an essential nutrient for humans because research has not yet identified a clear biological function for boron . However, it might have beneficial effects on such functions as reproduction and development, calcium metabolism, bone formation, brain function, insulin and energy substrate metabolism, immunity, and the function of steroid hormones (including vitamin D and estrogen) [1-14]. Boron is present in foods and beverages as inorganic borates as well as mono- or di-sugar-borate esters, such as calcium fructoborate . Most ingested boron is hydrolyzed to boric acid within the gastrointestinal tract . The body absorbs about 85%–90% of ingested boron . However, very little is known about how or where in the gastrointestinal tract absorption occurs . Boron does not accumulate in most body tissues, but bone, nails, and hair have higher boron levels than other body tissues, whereas fat has lower levels . Boric acid is the main form of boron in blood, urine, and other body fluids . The lack of substantial changes in blood boron levels in response to large increases in dietary intakes suggests that the body maintains boron homeostasis, likely by increasing urinary excretion, but the regulatory mechanisms for boron homeostasis have not been identified . Boron is excreted mainly in the urine, and small amounts are excreted in the feces, sweat, breath, and bile . Boron status is not routinely measured in clinical practice. Most studies suggest that urinary boron levels correlate with boron intakes . Fasting plasma concentrations of boron in postmenopausal women range from 34 to 95 ng/mL (3.14 to 8.79 mcmol/L) . Recommended Intakes Intake recommendations for nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by an expert committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine . DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following: Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects The FNB found the existing data insufficient to derive an RDA, AI, or EAR for boron . The World Health Organization estimates that an acceptable safe range of boron intakes for adults is 1–13 mg/day . Sources of Boron Food Plant foods—including fruit, tubers, and legumes—contain the largest amounts of boron . Wine, cider, and beer also contain boron . The main sources of boron in the diets of people in the United States are coffee, milk, apples, dried and cooked beans, and potatoes, primarily because people tend to consume large amounts of these foods . Among toddlers, 38% of boron intakes comes from fruits and fruit juices and 19% from milk and cheese . For adolescents, milk and cheese products account for 18%–20% of boron intakes, whereas beverages, especially instant coffee, represent the largest dietary source of boron for adults . The amount of boron in plant foods depends somewhat on the boron content of the soil and water where they were grown . Areas of the world with limited boron in the soil include Brazil, Japan, and most of the United States, mainly because of high levels of rainfall, which leaches boron out of the soil . In contrast, arid regions of the world—including California and parts of Turkey, Argentina, Chile, Russia, China, and Peru—have higher boron concentrations . Boron concentrations are about 0.27 mg/L in breast milk and 0.33 mg/L in cow’s milk . Water contains boron, but the concentration varies considerably by source . The median boron concentration of drinking water in the United States is 0.031 mg/L . Selected food sources of boron are listed in Table 1. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) FoodData Central does not list the boron content of foods or provide lists of foods containing boron. Therefore, information on boron levels in foods is limited.

Common amounts of elemental boron in dietary supplements range from 0.15 to 6 mg . In dietary supplements, boron is present in many different forms, including sodium borate, sodium tetraborate, boron amino acid chelate, boron ascorbate, boron aspartate, boron citrate, boron gluconate, boron glycinate, boron picolinate, and calcium fructoborate . In a small human study, boron as sodium tetraborate significantly increased plasma boron levels within 4–6 hours of consumption , but no data are available on the relative bioavailability of different forms of supplemental boron. The Supplement Facts label on a dietary supplement product declares the amount of elemental boron in the product, not the weight of the entire boron-containing compound. Boron Intakes and Status According to data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III; 1988–1994) and the Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (1994–1996), median dietary boron intakes range from 0.87 to 1.35 mg/day in adults, 1.05 to 1.08 mg/day in pregnant women, and 0.75 to 0.96 mg/day in school-age children . Vegetarians tend to have higher intakes of boron than nonvegetarians because boron is plentiful in plant foods . The median dietary boron intake in lactating women is 1.27 mg/day . Boron intakes are about 0.55 mg/day among infants and about 0.54 mg/day among toddlers . Total median boron intakes from dietary supplements and foods are about 1.0 to 1.5 mg/day for adults . Boron Deficiency In humans, boron deficiency signs and symptoms have not been firmly established. Limited data suggest that boron deficiency might affect brain function by reducing mental alertness and impairing executive brain function . In addition, a low-boron diet (0.25 mg boron/2,000 kcal) might elevate urinary calcium and magnesium excretion and lower serum concentrations of estrogen in postmenopausal women . Low boron intakes (0.23 mg boron/2,000 kcal) also appear to reduce plasma calcium and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and raise serum calcitonin and osteocalcin levels in men and women ; these changes could affect bone mineral density. Boron and Health This section focuses on three health areas in which boron might be involved: osteoarthritis, bone health, and cancer. Osteoarthritis Observational evidence combined with the findings from a few small clinical studies in humans suggests that boron might be helpful for reducing the symptoms of osteoarthritis, possibly by inhibiting inflammation [3,30-33]. In a small pilot study that compared 6 mg boron per day for 8 weeks with placebo, the supplements reduced symptoms of osteoarthritis in 20 participants younger than 75 years (mean age about 65 years) . Another 8-week study in 20 patients with mild to moderate or severe osteoarthritis found that 6 mg/day boron as calcium fructoborate for mild to moderate osteoarthritis or 12 mg/day boron for severe disease reduced joint rigidity and the use of ibuprofen for pain and increased mobility and flexibility . However, this study was very small and not blinded or placebo controlled. A subsequent double-blind, placebo-controlled trial examined the effects of 1.5, 3, or 6 mg/day boron (as calcium fructoborate) for 2 weeks on inflammatory biomarkers (e.g., C-reactive protein and fibrinogen) in 60 participants with osteoarthritis age 59–68 years . Supplementation significantly reduced inflammatory markers. In another double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, supplementation with 6 mg/day boron (as calcium fructoborate) for 2 weeks significantly reduced knee discomfort in 60 adults (mean age 50 years) with self-reported knee discomfort . These findings suggest that boron, particularly as calcium fructoborate, might hold promise for reducing osteoarthritis symptoms, but confirmation is needed from additional controlled trials. Bone health Boron might be important for bone growth and formation, possibly by affecting osteoblast and/or osteoclast activity or by influencing serum steroid hormone levels and calcium metabolism . Animal studies indicate that boron deficiency causes abnormal limb development; delayed maturation of growth plates; and decreased bone strength, bone volume fraction, and trabecular thickness . Comparisons of animals receiving boron supplementation with animals that consume usual or small amounts of boron show that the supplementation improves some measures of bone strength [36-38]. However, in an observational study in 134 Korean women (average age 41 years), boron intakes (mean of 0.9 mg/day) were not significantly correlated with bone mineral density in the lumbar spine or femoral regions . In a placebo-controlled clinical trial of 17 female athletes (mean age 19.8 years) and 11 sedentary females (mean age 20.3 years), 3 mg/day boron supplementation for 10 months significantly reduced serum phosphorus levels and increased serum magnesium levels in sedentary females; such changes are often associated with increased bone mineral density . However, supplementation in this study did not directly affect bone mineral density. Additional research is needed to determine whether boron supplementation affects bone health in humans. Cancer Preliminary evidence suggests that dietary boron intake might affect cancer risk. Several observational studies found that boron intakes are inversely associated with prostate cancer risk in men and with lung and cervical cancer risk in women [1,9,41-44]. For example, in a case control study of 763 women with lung cancer and 838 healthy women, those in the lowest quartile of boron intake (less than 0.78 mg/day) had almost twice the risk of lung cancer of those in the highest quartile (more than 1.25 mg/day) . An observational study in Turkey evaluated two criteria for prostate cancer risk, prostate size and prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels. Men with higher boron intakes (about 6 mg/day) had significantly smaller prostate glands than men who consumed less boron (0.64–0.88 mg/day) . However, PSA levels did not differ significantly between the two groups. No clinical trials have evaluated the effects of boron on cancer prevention or treatment. More research is needed to understand the effects, if any, of boron on cancer. Health Risks from Excessive Boron No data are available on adverse effects of high boron intakes from food or water . Symptoms associated with accidental consumption of boric acid or borax (sodium borate), contained in some household cleaning products and pesticides, include nausea, gastrointestinal discomfort, vomiting, diarrhea, skin flushing, rash, excitation, convulsions, depression, and vascular collapse . The amount of boron consumed in people who accidentally consumed boron ranged from 18 to 9,713 mg, and most were children younger than 6 years . Boron toxicity can also cause headache, hypothermia, restlessness, weariness, renal injury, dermatitis, alopecia, anorexia, and indigestion. In infants, high boron intakes have caused anemia, seizures, erythema, and thin hair . Extremely high doses of boron can be fatal; for example, 15,000 to 20,000 mg can cause death in adults . The FNB established boron ULs for healthy individuals based on levels associated with reproductive and developmental effects in animals .

Interactions with Medications Boron is not known to have any clinically relevant interactions with medications.

Introduction Carnitine, derived from an amino acid, is the generic term for several compounds, including L-carnitine, acetyl-L-carnitine, and propionyl-L-carnitine . Carnitine is naturally present in many foods—especially foods of animal origin—and is available as a dietary supplement. Carnitine is also synthesized endogenously in the liver, kidneys, and brain from the amino acids lysine and methionine . Carnitine is a conditionally essential nutrient because the requirements for carnitine exceed an individual’s ability to synthesize this nutrient only under certain conditions (e.g., premature birth or kidney disfunction) . Carnitine plays a critical role in energy production. It is an essential cofactor that helps transport long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria so that they can be oxidized to produce energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) . Carnitine also helps transport some toxic compounds out of the mitochondria . Carnitine is concentrated in tissues that oxidize fatty acids as a dietary fuel . About 95% of total body carnitine is stored in heart and skeletal muscle. Most of the remainder is stored in the liver and kidney, and circulating plasma contains only about 0.5% of the body’s carnitine. Excess plasma carnitine is excreted in urine . The body needs about 15 mg/day of carnitine from a combination of dietary sources and endogenous synthesis . Foods of animal origin provide most of the carnitine in American diets. A typical omnivorous diet provides about 24 to 145 mg carnitine daily for a person weighing 165 pounds. In contrast, a vegan diet provides about 1.2 mg carnitine . Endogenous carnitine synthesis does not appear to be affected by dietary carnitine intake or carnitine excretion and is sufficient to meet the carnitine needs of healthy people . A person weighing 165 lb who follows a strict vegetarian diet, for example, synthesizes approximately 14.4 mg/day carnitine . Carnitine status is not routinely assessed in clinical practice, but it can be determined by measuring circulating carnitine. A plasma free carnitine concentration of 20 mcmol/L or less, or a total carnitine concentration of 30 mcmol/L or less, is abnormally low . The ratio of acyl-L-carnitine ester to free L-carnitine can also be used to assess carnitine status because under normal conditions most carnitine is in the free unesterified form. A ratio of 0.4 or greater in plasma or serum indicates abnormal carnitine metabolism and suggests carnitine insufficiency . Recommended Intakes Healthy children and adults do not need to consume carnitine from food or supplements because the liver and kidneys synthesize sufficient amounts to meet daily needs . In 1989, the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine concluded that carnitine is not an essential nutrient . Therefore, the FNB did not establish Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) for carnitine . Sources of Carnitine Food Carnitine is present in animal products, especially red meat . Poultry, fish, and dairy foods also provide some carnitine, but vegetables, fruits, and grains provide negligible amounts . Dietary carnitine has a bioavailability of about 63% to 75% . The bioavailability of acetyl-L-carnitine has not been well studied . Data on the carnitine content of specific foods are limited. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA's) FoodData Central does not include the carnitine content of foods . Table 1 lists several foods and their approximate carnitine content per serving, based on several small studies. Table 1: Carnitine Content of Selected Foods Beef steak, cooked, 3 ounces: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 42–122 Ground beef, cooked, 3 ounces: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 65–74 Milk, whole, 1 cup: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 8 Codfish, cooked, 3 ounces: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 3–5 Chicken breast, cooked, 3 ounces: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 2–4 Ice cream, ½ cup: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 3 Cheese, cheddar, 2 ounces: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 2 Whole-wheat bread, 2 slices: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 0.2 Asparagus, cooked, ½ cup: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 0.1 Dietary supplements Carnitine is available in dietary supplements containing only carnitine or a combination of carnitine and other ingredients . The two main forms of carnitine in dietary supplements are L-carnitine and acetyl-L-carnitine, and amounts range from about 3 mg to 5,000 mg . Absorption of supplemental L-carnitine is about 14% to 18%, much less than that of dietary L-carnitine . Carnitine Deficiency Two types of carnitine deficiency states exist. Primary carnitine deficiency is a genetic disorder of the cellular carnitine transporter system that causes a shortage of carnitine within cells. Primary carnitine deficiency usually presents during infancy or early childhood. It can result in epilepsy and encephalopathy in infants; seizures, irregular heartbeat, and breathing problems in adolescents and young adults; and myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, cardiomyopathy, or sudden death in older people. Although some individuals with primary carnitine deficiency do not have symptoms, all affected people have an increased risk of heart failure, hepatic disorders, and coma . Secondary carnitine deficiency results from certain disorders (such as chronic renal failure) that reduce endogenous carnitine synthesis or increase its excretion or from chronic use of pivalate-containing medications that reduce carnitine absorption or increase its excretion . Signs and symptoms of secondary carnitine deficiency include hyperammonemic encephalopathy (malaise, seizures, and decreased consciousness caused by elevated ammonia levels), hypoglycemia, hypoketonemia (low level of ketones in the blood), dicarboxylic aciduria (increased concentrations of dicarboxylic acids in the urine), hyperuricemia (excess uric acid in the blood), muscle weakness, myoglobinuria (excess myoglobin in the urine), cardiomyopathy, and sudden death . Primary and secondary carnitine deficiency can be resolved with high doses (20–200 mg/kg/day) of supplemental carnitine . Groups at Risk of Carnitine Inadequacy The following groups are among those most likely to have inadequate carnitine status. Premature infants Babies born prematurely have high growth demands but have low carnitine stores and an inadequate ability to synthesize this nutrient . Premature infants may require supplemental carnitine in addition to that supplied in breast milk and fortified infant formula . Many enteral and parenteral formulas for premature infants are fortified with L-carnitine to improve lipid metabolism and promote weight gain . However, a Cochrane Review of six randomized clinical trials in newborns requiring parenteral nutrition (many of whom were premature) did not support the use of parenteral carnitine to improve lipid utilization or weight gain . Individuals with secondary carnitine deficiency due to end-stage renal disease, hemodialysis, or both Carnitine homeostasis in individuals with renal diseases can be impaired by reduced synthesis and increased elimination of carnitine by the kidneys. Renal diseases can also reduce carnitine intake from food because patients often have poor appetite and consume fewer animal products . Many patients with end-stage renal disease, particularly those on hemodialysis, become carnitine insufficient. Low levels of carnitine in blood and muscle stores can contribute to anemia, muscle weakness, fatigue, altered levels of blood fats, and heart disorders. Numerous studies suggest that high doses of supplemental carnitine (often injected) administered to patients on maintenance hemodialysis can correct some or all of these symptoms . However, most of these studies had small numbers of participants and were not double-blind clinical trials. The authors of a meta-analysis of these studies concluded that carnitine supplements might help patients manage their anemia but not their blood-lipid profiles, and that the effects of these supplements on exercise capacity and heart disorders were inconclusive . Carnitine and Health This section focuses on seven areas of health in which the role of supplemental carnitine is being investigated: Alzheimer’s disease and dementia, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and peripheral artery disease, insulin resistance and diabetes, infertility, osteoarthritis, athletic performance enhancement, and weight loss. Alzheimer’s disease and dementia Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by the accumulation of plaques and the degeneration of neurons in the brain, including cholinergic neurons involved in memory functions . Cholinergic neurons use the neurotransmitter acetylcholine , and Alzheimer’s disease is often treated by increasing acetylcholine levels or preventing its breakdown . Carnitine might be conditionally essential in individuals with Alzheimer’s disease because it may support acetylcholine synthesis and help remove toxic compounds to alleviate mitochondrial dysfunction associated with extensive degeneration of brain structures . Therefore, researchers have examined whether acetyl-L-carnitine supplements benefit individuals with Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia, but studies have had mixed results . In a 2003 meta-analysis of 21 clinical trials, a total of 1,204 adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer’s disease took supplements containing 1.5 to 3.0 g/day acetyl-L-carnitine or placebo for 3 to 12 months. Clinical and psychometric assessment scores were better, and improvements determined by clinicians were greater in supplement users than in the placebo groups . In contrast, a 2003 Cochrane Review of 15 clinical trials (including 13 of those in the meta-analysis described above) had somewhat different findings . The clinical trials assessed the effectiveness of 1 to 3 g/day acetyl-L-carnitine supplementation or placebo over 12 to 52 weeks in participants with mild to moderate dementia or cognitive decline. The results showed that the supplementation decreased symptom severity at 12 and 24 weeks but not at 52 weeks. Similarly, acetyl-L-carnitine supplements improved scores on the Mini Mental State Examination at 24 weeks but not at 12 or 52 weeks and had no effect on the severity of dementia, functional ability, or overall clinical global impression scores. The authors of the Cochrane Review noted that results from studies conducted more recently were less positive than those from earlier studies; they concluded that the routine clinical use of acetyl-L-carnitine supplements to treat the signs and symptoms of dementia was not justified. The effects of acetyl-L-carnitine supplements in Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia remain unclear and continue to be an area of active research . Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and peripheral artery disease Carnitine plays a role in transporting long-chain fatty acids in the myocardial mitochondria, where they are metabolized via oxidation for energy. It is also involved in moderating oxidative stress and might decrease markers of inflammation . During ischemic events, carnitine prevents fatty acid ester accumulation, which can lead to fatal ventricular arrhythmias . For these reasons, researchers are examining whether carnitine affects cardiovascular health. Clinical trials examining the effects of carnitine supplements on CVD have had mixed results. A meta-analysis of 13 clinical trials included a total of 3,629 adults with acute myocardial infarction who took either L-carnitine (from 2.7 g/day for 5 days to 6 g/day for 12 months) or placebo. The study found that L-carnitine significantly reduced rates of all-cause mortality, ventricular arrhythmias, and new-onset angina but did not affect risk of heart failure or myocardial reinfarction . The carnitine dose and duration of the clinical trial did not appear to affect outcomes. Another meta-analysis of 17 clinical trials that included a total of 1,625 adults with chronic heart failure found that 1 g/day to 6 g/day for 7 days to 3 years L-carnitine supplements improved left ventricular ejection fraction by 4.14%, stroke volume by 8.21 mL, and cardiac output by 0.88 L/min compared to routine/conventional treatment . These benefits did not vary by supplement dose or study duration. However, L-carnitine did not affect rates of all-cause mortality or performance on a timed walking test. Other research has raised concerns about the negative cardiovascular effects of chronic exposure to carnitine. A 2013 study that included 2,595 adults age 54–71 years undergoing elective cardiac evaluation found that L-carnitine is metabolized by intestinal microbiota to trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), a proatherogenic substance that is associated with increased CVD risk . Because of differences in intestinal bacteria composition, omnivorous study participants produced more TMAO than vegans or vegetarians after consumption of L-carnitine. The study also found dose-dependent associations between fasting plasma L-carnitine concentrations and risk of coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, and CVD, but only in participants with concurrently high TMAO levels. A 2022 clinical trial also found potentially deleterious outcomes in 157 individuals age 58 to 75 years with metabolic syndrome who received 1 g supplemental L-carnitine or placebo twice a day for 6 months . Although the results showed no differences in total plaque volume between groups, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were higher in participants taking L-carnitine. L-carnitine supplementation was also associated with 9.3% greater carotid arterial plaque stenosis in males who ate less red meat and had lower baseline stenosis and total plaque volume than other participants. Peripheral artery disease is a vascular disorder usually caused by atherosclerosis and its resulting arterial stenosis and occlusion. It is prevalent among older adults, although it is often underdiagnosed . Researchers have examined whether propionyl-L-carnitine, an acyl derivative of L-carnitine, mitigates the cramping leg pain of intermittent claudication, the main symptom of peripheral artery disease, but findings from studies have been mixed. A systematic review of three randomized clinical trials compared 234 participants who took 2 g/day oral propionyl-L-carnitine for 4 to 6 months with 222 patients who took placebo . In one trial, participants supplemented with propionyl-L-carnitine had improved peak walking times (walking until pain could not be tolerated), self-reported improvements in walking distance and speed, and decreased pain. The other two trials showed no benefit of propionyl-L-carnitine on peak walking time compared with placebo. More research is needed to fully understand the effects of carnitine on cardiovascular health. Insulin resistance and diabetes Insulin resistance plays an important role in the development of type 2 diabetes. Because insulin resistance may be associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and a defect in fatty-acid oxidation in muscle , carnitine supplementation has been studied for its possible effects on insulin resistance and diabetes. A 2023 meta-analysis of 41 randomized clinical trials examined the effects of L-carnitine supplementation on glycemic markers in 2,900 men and women age 18 years and older . Most participants had health conditions such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, polycystic ovary syndrome, or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. L-carnitine supplements at doses of 0.25 to 4 g/day for 2 to 52 weeks reduced fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) but not serum insulin levels. Other meta-analyses have had a narrower focus, examining only studies in specific populations. A 2017 meta-analysis included five randomized clinical trials (three of which were included in the 2023 meta-analysis described above) in a total of 631 adults with insulin resistance who took 2 or 3 g/day L-carnitine or placebo for 4 weeks to 12 months . The L-carnitine improved measures of insulin resistance, and the benefits at 12 months exceeded those at 3 months. A systematic review and meta-analysis of four randomized clinical trials (all of which were included in the 2023 meta-analysis described above) with a total of 284 adults with type 2 diabetes compared the metabolic effects of L-carnitine with those of placebo . The results showed that 2 or 3 g/day L-carnitine for 12 to 52 weeks reduced levels of fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and apolipoproteins B100 and A1 but not triglycerides, lipoprotein (a), or HbA1c. Additional clinical trials with larger samples are needed to determine whether L-carnitine supplements can reduce the risk of diabetes or the severity of its clinical manifestations. Infertility Carnitine might play a role in sperm maturation, sperm motility, and spermatogenesis . It might also reduce oxidative stress, which could improve oocyte growth and maturation . Therefore, researchers are examining whether supplemental carnitine improves sperm count, concentration, and motility as well as pregnancy rates. A systematic review and meta-analysis of three randomized clinical trials examined the effects of 1 g/day to 3 g/day L-carnitine or acetyl-L-carnitine for 2 to 6 months on sperm parameters in 201 men age 20 to 40 years who had infertility . Compared to placebo, supplemental carnitine improved sperm motility by 7.84% and morphology by 4.91% but did not affect sperm concentration. A 2022 Cochrane Review assessed the effectiveness of carnitine supplementation on male subfertility (delays in conception due to low sperm concentration) . The review included six randomized clinical trials in a total of 1,089 men with subfertility who took 1,000 to 3,000 mg/day carnitine for 8 weeks to 6 months. In some trials, carnitine was compared with placebo, whereas in others, it was compared with antioxidants (such as vitamin C or vitamin E) or a control group that received no treatment. Carnitine supplementation increased sperm motility and concentration at some timepoints (e.g., 3 months) but did not affect rates of live birth or pregnancy. Researchers have also examined whether carnitine might improve ovulation and pregnancy rates in females with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a condition that commonly causes infertility. In one 26-month randomized controlled trial, 170 women younger than 35 years took clomiphene citrate and either 3 g/day supplemental L-carnitine or placebo from day 3 of their menstrual cycle until the day of their first positive pregnancy test result . Individuals in the group taking L-carnitine had 64.4% higher ovulation rates and thicker endometrial tissue (10.1 mm vs. 6.8 mm) than those in the placebo group. In addition, more participants in the L-carnitine group became pregnant than those who took placebo, and they had fewer miscarriages. In a 3-month randomized controlled trial, 280 women with PCOS received either 3 g L-carnitine or placebo . Participants who took L-carnitine supplements had improved menstrual cycle regularity and higher ovulation and pregnancy rates, but miscarriage rates did not differ between the groups. More research is needed to determine whether carnitine supplements affect male infertility or pregnancy rates in women with PCOS. Osteoarthritis Some research suggests that carnitine reduces levels of C-reactive protein, a biomarker of systemic inflammation, and levels of malondialdehyde, a lipid peroxidation product that induces pain and disability in patients with osteoarthritis . In addition, levels of acylcarnitines (conjugated carnitine esters) are lower in people with osteoarthritis than in age- and gender-matched healthy individuals . For these reasons, investigators are studying whether L-carnitine supplements can relieve osteoarthritis symptoms , but study results have been mixed. A randomized clinical trial examined the anti-inflammatory effects of L-carnitine supplementation for osteoarthritis management in 69 women age 40 to 60 years with mild to moderate osteoarthritis in both knees . The women took 250 mg L-carnitine three times a day or placebo for 8 weeks. Serum levels of several inflammation biomarkers and pain scores were lower in the carnitine group than in the placebo group: Interleukin-1-beta levels decreased 5.53%, matrix metalloproteinase-1 levels decreased 9.10%, and the visual analog scale of pain decreased 52.67%. In another randomized clinical trial, 76 women (average age 55 years) with obesity and knee osteoarthritis took 1 g/day L-carnitine or placebo for 12 weeks . In comparison with placebo, carnitine did not reduce osteoarthritis pain or stiffness or increase physical function. Larger studies with samples that include both men and women are needed to determine whether carnitine supplementation helps manage osteoarthritis symptoms. Athletic performance enhancement Carnitine helps preserve muscle glycogen and promote fat oxidation. It also spares the use of amino acids as energy sources during exercise, making them potentially available for new protein synthesis , and decreases the accumulation of lactate . However, research findings on the effectiveness of supplemental carnitine on athletic performance are mixed . One study randomly assigned 14 recreational athletes age 24–28 years with an average body mass index (BMI) of 23 to consume a carbohydrate solution with or without 2.0 g of L-carnitine tartrate twice a day for 24 weeks . At the end of the trial, perceived exertion on a cycle ergometer at a workload of 50% and then 80% of maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max, a measure of aerobic fitness and endurance capacity) was lower in the carnitine group (14.0, Borg scale) than in the control group (16.2). In another study, 24 men age 18–40 years (eight omnivores and 16 vegetarians) took 1 g L-carnitine twice daily for 12 weeks . Each participant performed a 60-minute cycling exercise at 75% VO2max at the beginning and end of the trial. Carnitine supplementation had no significant effect on VO2max, blood lactate concentration, skeletal muscle energy metabolism, or physical performance in either the vegetarians or the omnivores. Carnitine supplementation increased skeletal muscle carnitine stores in the vegetarians, but not the omnivores, by approximately 13%. A 2018 comprehensive review summarized the effects of supplemental L-carnitine on exercise performance and recovery in well-trained athletes (age 16–36 years) and recreationally active adults (age 18–50 years) . The review included 11 clinical trials (one of which was the trial described above) in a total of 251 well-trained athletes who took 1 to 4 grams L-carnitine or placebo a single time or once or twice daily for up to 6 months. L-carnitine supplements reduced lactate levels and heart rate; increased lipid metabolism, VO2max, oxygen consumption, and L-carnitine plasma concentrations; improved performance; and hastened recovery in some of the studies. However, the supplements did not affect performance or maximal exercise test results in other studies. In 17 studies that included recreationally active adults, a total of 237 participants took 2 g L-carnitine once or 2 to 4 g L-carnitine or placebo once or twice daily for up to 3 months. L-carnitine decreased plasma lactate concentrations, pyruvate concentrations, and muscle soreness and increased VO2max and recovery in some studies. However, in other studies, L-carnitine did not affect lactate, heart rate, VO2max, endurance, performance time, or perceived exertion during exercise. A systematic review of 11 randomized clinical trials examined the effects of oral L-carnitine supplementation on high- and moderate-intensity exercise performance in a total of 203 physically active and untrained adults age 18 to 46 years . Participants took 3 to 4 g/day L-carnitine for 1 week or 1 to 3 g/day for 4 to 24 weeks or placebo (or, in one study also described above, a carbohydrate solution). The studies had mixed results. Some studies found significant improvements in VO2max, peak power, maximum sprinting power, perceived exertion, and number of repetitions and volume lifted in a leg press in the L-carnitine group. However, other studies found no differences in VO2max, fatigue, maximum and average power, or total work on a cycle ergometer. No studies found that L-carnitine supplementation improved moderate-intensity exercise performance. Overall, the evidence on supplemental carnitine’s effectiveness for performance enhancement is mixed, and additional investigations are needed. Weight loss Because carnitine transports fatty acids into the mitochondria and acts as a cofactor for fatty acid oxidation, researchers have proposed using L-carnitine supplements to promote weight loss, often in conjunction with a low-calorie diet, exercise, or prescription weight-loss drugs . Weight loss has been a secondary outcome in most studies, and these studies have had equivocal results. In a randomized clinical trial in 258 adults age 47–59 years with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, participants who took 2 g/day L-carnitine plus the prescription medication orlistat (360 mg/day) for 1 year lost more weight (11.3 kg) than those who took orlistat alone (9.5 kg) . However, in another randomized clinical trial, 2 g/day L-carnitine alone for 6 months did not affect weight loss in 94 men and women who were overweight (age 43–58 years; BMI range 24.6–29.8) and had newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes . A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis combined the results from nine randomized clinical trials in adults (including the two described above) that assessed carnitine’s effects on weight loss . The trials included a total of 911 participants. In eight trials, doses ranged from 1.8 to 4 g/day L-carnitine for 30 to 360 days; in the ninth trial, the dose was 15 mg/kg/day for 182 days. Study participants who took carnitine supplements lost an average of 1.33 kg more weight than those who took a placebo, regardless of the study duration or L-carnitine dose. Larger studies are needed to determine whether carnitine supplementation affects weight loss. Health Risks from Excessive Carnitine Carnitine does not have an established tolerable upper intake level. However, doses of approximately 3 g/day of carnitine supplements can cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and a fishy body odor . It can also cause muscle weakness in people with uremia and seizures in those with seizure disorders. Some research indicates that intestinal bacteria metabolize unabsorbed carnitine to form TMAO and gamma-butyrobetaine , which might increase the risk of CVD . This effect appears to be more pronounced in people who consume meat than in vegans or vegetarians. The implications of these findings are not well understood and require more research. Interactions with Medications Several types of medications have the potential to interact with carnitine supplements. A few examples are provided below. People taking these and other medications on a regular basis should discuss their carnitine intake with their healthcare providers. Pivalate-conjugated antibiotics Carnitine interacts with pivalate-conjugated antibiotics, such as pivampicillin, that are used to prevent urinary tract infections . Chronic administration of these antibiotics can lead to carnitine depletion. However, although tissue carnitine levels in people who take these antibiotics may become low enough to limit fatty acid oxidation, no cases of illness due to carnitine deficiency in this population have been described . Valproic acid and other anticonvulsants Treatment with the anticonvulsants valproic acid, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine reduces blood levels of carnitine . In addition, the use of valproic acid with or without other anticonvulsants may cause hepatotoxicity and increase plasma ammonia concentrations, leading to encephalopathy . This toxicity may also occur after acute valproic acid overdoses. Intravenous L-carnitine administration might help treat valproic acid toxicity in children and adults, although the optimal regimen has not been identified . Carnitine and Healthful Diets The federal government’s 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that “Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. … In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).” For more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate.

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet. Introduction Choline is an essential nutrient that is naturally present in some foods and available as a dietary supplement. Choline is a source of methyl groups needed for many steps in metabolism. The body needs choline to synthesize phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin, two major phospholipids vital for cell membranes. Therefore, all plant and animal cells need choline to preserve their structural integrity . In addition, choline is needed to produce acetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter for memory, mood, muscle control, and other brain and nervous system functions [1-3]. Choline also plays important roles in modulating gene expression, cell membrane signaling, lipid transport and metabolism, and early brain development . Humans can produce choline endogenously in the liver, mostly as phosphatidylcholine, but the amount that the body naturally synthesizes is not sufficient to meet human needs . As a result, humans must obtain some choline from the diet. Premenopausal women might need less choline from the diet than children or other adults because estrogen induces the gene that catalyzes the biosynthesis of choline . When a diet is deficient in folate, a B-vitamin that is also a methyl donor, the need for dietary choline rises because choline becomes the primary methyl donor . The most common sources of choline in foods are the fat-soluble phospholipids phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin as well as the water-soluble compounds phosphocholine, glycerolphosphocholine, and free choline . When these choline-containing compounds are ingested, pancreatic and mucosal enzymes liberate free choline from about half of the fat-soluble forms and some water-soluble forms . Free choline, phosphocholine, and glycerophosphocholine are absorbed in the small intestine, enter the portal circulation, and are stored in the liver, where they are subsequently phosphorylated and distributed throughout the body to make cell membranes [1-3]. The remaining fat-soluble phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin) are absorbed intact, incorporated into chylomicrons, and secreted into the lymphatic circulation, where they are distributed to tissues and other organs, including the brain and placenta . Choline status is not routinely measured in healthy people. In healthy adults, the concentration of choline in plasma ranges from 7 to 20 mcmol/L . According to one study, the range is 7–9.3 mcmol/L in fasting adults . Plasma choline levels do not decline below 50% of normal, even in individuals who have not eaten for more than a week . This may be due to the hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids, a source of choline, to maintain plasma choline concentrations above this minimal level, or to endogenous synthesis . Recommended Intakes Intake recommendations for choline and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the Institute of Medicine . DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following: Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects Insufficient data were available to establish an EAR for choline, so the FNB established AIs for all ages that are based on the prevention of liver damage as measured by serum alanine aminostransferase levels . The amount of choline that individuals need is influenced by the amount of methionine, betaine, and folate in the diet; gender; pregnancy; lactation; stage of development; ability to produce choline endogenously; and genetic mutations that affect choline needs . Table 1 lists the current AIs for choline . Table 1: Adequate Intakes (AIs) for Choline Birth to 6 months: Male: 125 mg/day, Female: 125 mg/day, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  7–12 months: Male: 150 mg/day, Female: 150 mg/day, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  1–3 years: Male: 200 mg/day, Female: 200 mg/day, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  4–8 years: Male: 250 mg/day, Female: 250 mg/day, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  9–13 years: Male: 375 mg/day, Female: 375 mg/day, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  14–18 years: Male: 550 mg/day, Female: 400 mg/day, Pregnancy: 450 mg/day, Lactation: 550 mg/day 19+ years: Male: 550 mg/day, Female: 425 mg/day, Pregnancy: 450 mg/day, Lactation: 550 mg/day Sources of Choline Food Many foods contain choline . The main dietary sources of choline in the United States consist primarily of animal-based products that are particularly rich in choline—meat, poultry, fish, dairy products, and eggs [4,5,8-10]. Cruciferous vegetables and certain beans are also rich in choline, and other dietary sources of choline include nuts, seeds, and whole grains. About half the dietary choline consumed in the United States is in the form of phosphatidylcholine . Many foods also contain lecithin, a substance rich in phosphatidylcholine that is prepared during commercial purification of phospholipids; lecithin is a common food additive used as an emulsifying agent in processed foods, such as gravies, salad dressings, and margarine . Choline is also present in breast milk and is added to most commercial infant formulas . Precise estimates of the percentage absorption of the different forms of dietary choline in humans are not available . Several food sources of choline are listed in Table 2.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for choline is 550 mg for adults and children age 4 years and older . FDA does not require food labels to list choline content unless choline has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) FoodData Central lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides a comprehensive list of foods containing choline arranged by nutrient content. Dietary supplements Choline is available in dietary supplements containing choline only, in combination with B-complex vitamins, and in some multivitamin/mineral products . Typical amounts of choline in dietary supplements range from 10 mg to 250 mg. The forms of choline in dietary supplements include choline bitartrate, phosphatidylcholine, and lecithin. No studies have compared the relative bioavailability of choline from these different forms. Choline Intakes and Status Most people in the United States consume less than the AI for choline. An analysis of data from the 2013–2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) found that the average daily choline intake from foods and beverages among children and teens is 256 mg for ages 2–19 . In adults, the average daily choline intake from foods and beverages is 402 mg in men and 278 mg in women. Intakes from supplements contribute a very small amount to total choline intakes. According to an analysis of 2007–2008 NHANES data, black males of all ages had lower mean choline intakes than their white and Hispanic counterparts, but choline intakes did not differ substantially among females of different races/ethnicities . Choline Deficiency Choline deficiency can cause muscle damage, liver damage, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD or hepatosteatosis) . Although most people in the United States consume less than the AI of choline, frank choline deficiency in healthy men and nonpregnant women is very rare, possibly because of the contribution of choline that the body synthesizes endogenously . Groups at Risk of Choline Inadequacy The following groups are among those most likely to have inadequate choline status. Pregnant women Approximately 90%–95% of pregnant women consume less choline than the AI . Prenatal dietary supplements typically contain little if any choline . The risk of inadequate choline status might be greater in pregnant and lactating women who do not take folic acid supplements, those with low vitamin B12 status, and those with a common variant in methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (an enzyme that can affect folate status), all of which reduce the body’s pool of methyl groups needed for metabolism [17-20]. Some evidence indicates that lower plasma or serum choline levels (e.g., serum concentration of 2.77 mmol/L in midpregnancy) are associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects . However, other research found no relationship between plasma choline concentrations during pregnancy and neural tube defects in offspring . People with certain genetic alterations Genes involved in the metabolism of choline, folate, and methionine play a role in the pathways for choline production and use . Humans have variations in the DNA sequences for these genes (single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]), and these SNPs can have a strong influence on demands for dietary choline. For example, one common SNP in the PEMT gene reduces endogenous synthesis of choline in women induced by estrogen . The prevalence of SNPs that alter requirements for dietary choline vary by race. In a study of 100 African, Asian, Caucasian, and Mexican Americans, individuals of European ancestry had a higher prevalence of four SNPs that increased the risk of organ dysfunction when these individuals consumed a low-choline diet . Patients requiring total parenteral nutrition At present, choline is not routinely added to commercial parenteral solutions for infants and adults . As a result, adults and infants receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) over the long term have low plasma choline concentrations (approximately 5 nmol/ml in adults and 5.7 nmol/ml in infants), which can result in hepatic abnormalities, including NAFLD [30-32]. The American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition recommends the routine addition of choline to adult and pediatric parenteral nutrition formulations and calls for the development of a commercially available parenteral product that contains choline . Choline and Health This section focuses on three conditions in which choline might play a role: cardiovascular and peripheral artery disease, neurological disorders, and NAFLD. Choline is involved in functions that overlap with those of folate and other B vitamins. Many studies do not assess the status of all B vitamins, which can confound results and obscure the true relationship between choline and the observed outcome. Cardiovascular and peripheral artery disease Some researchers have suggested that choline might protect cardiovascular health by reducing blood pressure, altering lipid profiles, and reducing levels of plasma homocysteine . Other research suggests that higher dietary choline might increase cardiovascular disease risk because some choline and other dietary ingredients, such as carnitine, are converted to trimethylamine (TMA) by intestinal bacteria. The TMA is then absorbed and converted by the liver into trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), a substance that has been linked to a higher risk of cardiovascular disease . Despite the hypothesis that choline might affect heart health, several large observational studies have found no significant associations between choline intakes and cardiovascular or peripheral artery disease risk. An analysis of 72,348 women in the Nurses’ Health Study and 44,504 men in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study showed no association between choline intake and risk of peripheral artery disease in men or women . Similarly, a prospective study in 14,430 middle-age adults in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study found that over 14 years, risk of coronary heart disease was not significantly different in the highest choline intake quartile compared to the lowest quartile . Choline intakes also had no association with cardiovascular disease risk in a study of 16,165 women participating in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition . However, a more recent analysis of data on 80,978 women from the Nurses’ Health Study and 39,434 men from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study found an increased risk of mortality in those consuming higher levels of choline . The authors suggest that the higher risk might be due to increased production of TMAO, although they did not directly measure TMAO. Additional research is needed to determine the relationship between choline intakes and cardiovascular and peripheral artery disease as well as the potential risks and benefits of choline supplementation to reduce the risk of these diseases. Neurological disorders People with Alzheimer’s disease have lower levels of the enzyme that converts choline into acetylcholine in the brain . In addition, because phosphatidylcholine can serve as a phospholipid precursor, it might help support the structural integrity of neurons and thus might promote cognitive function in elderly adults . Some experts have therefore theorized that consuming higher levels of phosphatidylcholine could reduce the progression of dementia in people with Alzheimer’s disease . However, little research conducted to date supports this hypothesis, as described below. A few observational studies have shown a link between cognitive performance in adults and both higher choline intakes and plasma concentrations. In one observational study in 2,195 adults age 70–74 years in Norway, participants with plasma free choline concentrations lower than 8.4 mcmol/L (20th percentile of concentrations in the study population) had poorer sensorimotor speed, perceptual speed, executive function, and global cognition than those with choline concentrations higher than 8.4 mcmol/L . A second study in 1,391 adults age 36–83 years from the Framingham Offspring study who completed food frequency questionnaires from 1991 to 1995 and again from 1998 to 2001 found that those with higher choline intakes had better verbal memory and visual memory . Furthermore, higher choline intakes during the earlier period were associated with smaller white matter hyperintensity volume (a high volume is a sign of small-vessel disease in the brain). Some small randomized intervention trials have shown that choline supplements improve cognitive performance in adults . However, a 2015 systematic review of 13 studies on the relationship between choline levels and neurological outcomes in adults found that choline supplements did not result in clear improvements in cognition in healthy adults . Similarly, a 2003 Cochrane Review of 12 randomized trials in 265 patients with Alzheimer’s disease, 21 with Parkinsonian dementia, and 90 with self-identified memory problems found no clear clinical benefits of lecithin supplementation for treating Alzheimer’s disease or Parkinsonian dementia . Future studies are needed to clarify the relationship between choline intakes and cognitive function and determine whether choline supplements might benefit patients with Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD involves the accumulation of lipids in the livers of people who consume less than 20 g/day ethanol and who have no other known causes of steatosis . (A single drink [e.g., 12 oz beer, 5 oz wine, or 1.5 oz hard liquor] contains about 12–14 g alcohol.) It is the most common chronic liver disorder, present in up to 65% of individuals who are overweight and 90% of those with obesity . Although it is often benign, NAFLD can lead to steatohepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer . Choline, especially phosphatidylcholine, is essential for transporting lipids from the liver . Therefore, in choline deficiency, fat accumulates in the liver, which can result in NAFLD . Although most women of childbearing age are resistant to NAFLD because of their high estrogen levels, at least 40% have a polymorphism that makes them insensitive to activation of the gene by estrogen; adequate consumption of dietary choline is particularly important for this population . Data from a single large observational study support a link between choline deficiency and risk of NAFLD. Specifically, a cross-sectional study of 56,195 Chinese adults age 40–75 years found an inverse relationship between dietary choline intakes and risk of NAFLD based on 24-hour dietary recall . The risk of NAFLD was 32% lower in women in the highest quintile of choline intake (412 mg/day) compared to the lowest (179 mg/day) and 25% lower in men in the highest (452 mg/day) quintile compared to those in the lowest (199 mg/day). However, choline intake was associated with NAFLD in normal-weight women only and not in those with overweight or obesity. This difference by weight status was not observed in men. In a cross-sectional study of 664 adults and children from the Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network, postmenopausal women who had nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (an extreme form of NAFLD involving liver inflammation and fibrosis) and a choline intake less than 50% of the AI had more severe fibrosis, but the results showed no relationship between choline intake and degree of liver steatosis . Only limited data are available on the use of choline to treat NAFLD. For example, in a study of 57 adults who consumed a diet that included less than 50 mg choline per 70 kg body weight per day (<10% of the AI) for up to 42 days, 37 of the participants developed liver dysfunction . Liver function returned to normal in 29 participants in this study after they were fed a diet containing 25%–75% of the choline AI and in eight who consumed an ad libitum diet. A pilot study in 15 adults on TPN found that NAFLD resolved completely in all patients who received their usual TPN regimen with an additional 2 g choline and in none of the patients who received their usual TPN regimen only . Adequate choline intake is needed for proper liver function and to prevent NAFLD, but more research is needed to further clarify the role of choline in preventing or treating NAFLD . Health Risks from Excessive Choline High intakes of choline are associated with a fishy body odor, vomiting, excessive sweating and salivation, hypotension, and liver toxicity . Choline consumption has been shown to increase production of TMAO, a substance that has been linked to a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, in a dose-dependent manner in adults. The FNB has established ULs for choline from food and supplements based on the amounts of choline that are associated with hypotension and fishy body odor (see Table 3) . The ULs apply to healthy children and adults but not to those taking high doses of choline under medical supervision. The FNB was unable to establish ULs for infants due to the lack of data on adverse effects in this age group.

Interactions with Medications Choline is not known to have any clinically relevant interactions with medications. Choline and Healthful Diets The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\" For more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that Includes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils.
