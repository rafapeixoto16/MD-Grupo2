Dietary supplements are products intended to add to or "supplement" the diet, and they can come in various forms such as tablets,
 capsules, and liquids. They are designed to contain dietary ingredients like vitamins, minerals, herbs, and amino acids that can help
 improve or maintain overall health. For someone with diabetes, like yourself, certain supplements may be beneficial in meeting daily
 nutrient requirements. However, it's essential to note that supplements should not replace a healthy and varied diet. While they can
  be beneficial, there are also potential health risks associated with taking dietary supplements.

It's crucial to understand the benefits and risks before deciding to take any supplement, especially
considering your health condition. I don't have information on specific supplements that would be suitable for your condition,
but it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best course of action for your individual needs
