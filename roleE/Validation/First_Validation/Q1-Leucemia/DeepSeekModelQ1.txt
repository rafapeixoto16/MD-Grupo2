Dietary supplements are products intended to supplement the diet, available in forms such as tablets, capsules,
 and gummies. They contain dietary ingredients like vitamins, minerals, herbs, and amino acids to support health
  and prevent deficiencies. While they can enhance nutrient intake and overall well-being, they shouldn't replace
  a balanced diet. For someone with leukemia, consulting a healthcare provider is essential, as supplements may
  interact with treatments or have side effects. Always seek professional advice for personalized guidance.
