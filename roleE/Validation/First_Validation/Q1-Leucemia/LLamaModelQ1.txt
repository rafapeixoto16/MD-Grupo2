 Dietary supplements are products intended to supplement the diet, coming in various forms such as tablets, capsules,
 and liquids. They contain dietary ingredients like vitamins, minerals, herbs, and amino acids, aiming to add to or enhance
 the diet. These supplements can be beneficial for overall health, helping to meet daily requirements of essential nutrients,
  such as calcium and vitamin D for strong bones. However, they should not replace a healthy and varied diet.
