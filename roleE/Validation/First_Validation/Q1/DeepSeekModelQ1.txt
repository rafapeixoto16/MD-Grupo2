Dietary supplements are products designed to complement or enhance the diet by providing additional nutrients or substances that may not be sufficiently obtained through food alone. They are available in various forms, including tablets, capsules, softgels, liquids, gummies, powders, and bars. These supplements contain dietary ingredients such as vitamins, minerals, herbs, botanicals, amino acids, enzymes, and probiotics, which are intended to support overall health and well-being.

The purpose of dietary supplements is to help individuals meet their daily nutritional needs, address potential deficiencies, and promote specific health benefits. For example, calcium and vitamin D supplements are often used to support bone health. However, it is important to note that supplements should not replace a balanced and varied diet, as they are meant to supplement, not substitute, whole foods.

While dietary supplements can offer health benefits, they may also carry risks. It is crucial to be aware of these potential risks and to consult with healthcare professionals before starting any supplement regimen to ensure safe and appropriate use.
