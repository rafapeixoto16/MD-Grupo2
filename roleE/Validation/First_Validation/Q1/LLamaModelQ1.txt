Dietary supplements are products intended to add to or "supplement" the diet,
and they can come in various forms such as tablets, capsules, softgels, and liquids.
 These products contain dietary ingredients like vitamins, minerals, herbs, and amino acids,
  which are meant to supplement the diet. The purpose of dietary supplements is to help improve or
  maintain overall health, and some can assist in meeting daily requirements of essential nutrients.
  For instance, calcium and vitamin D supplements can contribute to building strong bones. However,
  it is essential to note that dietary supplements should not replace a healthy and varied diet.

It is crucial to understand that while dietary supplements can be beneficial, they can also involve
health risks. Therefore, it is necessary to be informed about the facts before deciding to take a supplement.

To obtain more accurate information and guidance on dietary supplements, it is always recommended to consult
 with healthcare professionals.
