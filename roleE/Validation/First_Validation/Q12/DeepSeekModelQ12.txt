Biotin is often promoted for improving hair, nail, and skin health, but the evidence supporting its effectiveness is
limited and primarily based on small studies and case reports. For nails, some studies suggest that biotin supplementation,
typically at doses of 2.5 mg/day, may improve nail thickness and firmness in individuals with brittle nails. For example,
one study found a 25% increase in nail thickness in patients with brittle nails after biotin supplementation, while another
 reported that 91% of participants experienced firmer and harder fingernails. However, the evidence is not entirely consistent,
 and some studies did not show statistically significant improvements.

Regarding hair health, the current evidence is limited to case reports in children with rare hair disorders, such as uncombable
hair syndrome, where biotin supplementation improved hair health. There is no strong evidence to support biotin's effectiveness
for hair health in adults.

As for nail color, there is no information in the provided context suggesting that biotin supplementation changes the color of
nails. The studies focus on improvements in nail thickness, firmness, and overall health rather than color changes.

In summary, while biotin may offer some benefits for nail health in specific cases, the evidence is not robust, and more
research is needed to confirm its effectiveness, especially in healthy individuals. It is always recommended to consult a
healthcare professional before starting any supplementation to obtain personalized advice.
