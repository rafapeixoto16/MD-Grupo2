 To strengthen the immune system and potentially aid in curing possible flus, several supplements have shown promise based on available research:

1. **Zinc**: Plays a crucial role in reducing the severity and duration of cold and flu symptoms by inhibiting viral replication and suppressing inflammation. It is available in forms like citrate, gluconate, and oxide, with varying absorption rates. Zinc is also found in nasal sprays for cold and flu relief.

2. **Vitamin C**: Known for its ability to modulate the immune response and suppress cytokines, helping to reduce the severity of infections.

3. **Vitamin D**: Supports immune function and can attenuate the immune response, potentially reducing the severity of flu symptoms.

4. **Echinacea purpurea**: Helps alleviate respiratory symptoms and reduce inflammatory cytokines, which are often elevated in flu patients.

5. **Ginseng**: Assists in reducing serum levels of inflammatory cytokines, providing relief from respiratory symptoms.

Considerations:
- Zinc absorption can be affected by iron supplements, so timing intake appropriately is advisable.
- Individuals with osteoporosis, especially those on calcium supplements, should consult their healthcare provider to avoid potential interactions.

Always consult a healthcare professional before starting new supplements to ensure safety and efficacy, especially with pre-existing conditions like osteoporosis.
