 To strengthen the immune system and help cure possible flus, certain supplements have shown potential benefits. Zinc, for instance, is known to support immune system health and has been used to treat or prevent the common cold and manage flu symptoms. The absorption of zinc from supplements is approximately 61% in young adults, and it is available in various forms, including zinc citrate, zinc gluconate, and zinc oxide. However, it is essential to note that taking iron supplements with zinc can reduce zinc absorption.

In addition to zinc, other supplements such as vitamins C and D, as well as herbal supplements like Echinacea purpurea and ginseng, may help alleviate respiratory symptoms and reduce serum levels of inflammatory cytokines. These supplements have been found to have antimicrobial activity and the potential to modulate T helper cell response, which can help attenuate the immune response.

It is crucial to consider individual factors, such as age and pre-existing conditions like osteoporosis, when selecting supplements to support immune health. As a 43-year-old individual with osteoporosis, it is essential to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best course of supplementation.

In conclusion, while certain supplements like zinc, vitamins C and D, and herbal supplements may help support immune health and alleviate flu symptoms, it is always necessary to consult with a healthcare professional to obtain more accurate information and determine the best approach for individual needs.
