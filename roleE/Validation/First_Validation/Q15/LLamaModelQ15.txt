Prolonged use of medication can indeed cause nutritional deficiencies. This is particularly concerning for individuals who are already at risk, such as older adults, pregnant patients, and those with certain medical conditions or dietary restrictions. Long-term drug use can alter nutrient absorption, metabolism, or excretion, leading to deficiencies in essential micronutrients like vitamins and minerals.

At any age, including 22, it is possible for medication use to contribute to nutritional deficiencies, especially if the individual has a restricted diet, poor appetite, or increased requirements due to medical conditions. However, the risk may be more pronounced in older adults or those with specific health conditions.

It is essential to be aware of the potential for medication-induced nutritional deficiencies and to take steps to prevent or address them, such as through supplementation or dietary adjustments.

For more accurate information and personalized advice, it is recommended to consult with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian.
