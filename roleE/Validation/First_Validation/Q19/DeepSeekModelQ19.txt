Before starting to take supplements, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional.
They can help determine if supplementation is necessary and ensure it is safe, especially if you are taking medications
or have underlying health conditions. Testing may be recommended to identify any deficiencies or potential interactions.

When purchasing supplements online, be cautious of products that make exaggerated health claims, as they may not be regulated
or could be counterfeit. Always choose reputable sources and verify the product's authenticity. Consulting with a healthcare
professional before buying supplements online can help mitigate these risks.

For more accurate and personalized advice, it is recommended to contact a healthcare professional.
