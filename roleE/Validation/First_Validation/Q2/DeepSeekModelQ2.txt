 Dietary supplements and medicines serve distinct purposes and are regulated differently. Dietary supplements are products intended to enhance the diet by providing vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids, and other dietary substances. They are not meant to treat, cure, or prevent diseases but rather to support overall health. Medicines, however, are designed to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent diseases, and they must undergo rigorous testing and FDA approval to ensure safety and efficacy.

Given your health condition, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional before using any supplements or medications to ensure they are appropriate and safe for your specific needs.
