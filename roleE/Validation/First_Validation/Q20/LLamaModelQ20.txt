 To determine if you need a supplement, it's essential to consider your overall health and diet. At 22 years old, you may want to assess whether you're consistently consuming a well-balanced diet that provides all the necessary nutrients. If not, a daily multivitamin may be beneficial. However, it's crucial to note that results of large-scale randomized trials have shown no overall benefit of multivitamins for the majority of patients.

Some micronutrients that commonly require supplementation include vitamin D, iron, vitamin A, zinc, folate, and iodine. If you're deficient in any of these, taking a supplement may be necessary. Nevertheless, it's vital to take recommended dosages and consult your physician if you notice any adverse effects, such as itching, loss of appetite, or severe abdominal pain.

As for how long it takes for a supplement to start working, this information is not available. The effects of supplements can vary depending on the individual and the specific nutrient. It's also important to be aware of potential interactions with other medications or supplements.

To ensure safe and effective use of supplements, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional. They can help you determine if a supplement is necessary and recommend the appropriate dosage. Additionally, be cautious of products that claim to diagnose, cure, or prevent diseases, and always follow the recommended guidelines.

It is always necessary to contact professionals to obtain more accurate information before references.
