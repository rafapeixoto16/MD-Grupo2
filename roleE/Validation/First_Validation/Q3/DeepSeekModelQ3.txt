Dietary supplements are regulated by the FDA, but not in the same way as medications. The FDA oversees dietary supplements under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA), which requires manufacturers to ensure their products are safe and properly labeled before marketing. However, unlike drugs, dietary supplements do not require FDA approval before being sold. The FDA monitors the marketplace, inspects manufacturing facilities, and can take enforcement action if a product is unsafe or mislabeled. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulates advertising for dietary supplements to ensure claims are truthful and not misleading. While there are regulations in place, they differ from those for prescription or over-the-counter medications. Always consult a healthcare professional before taking any supplement, especially if you have a condition like diabetes.
