Supplements are not regulated in the same manner as medications. They are subject to a different set of regulations,
 as outlined in the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994. The FDA regulates dietary supplements under this act,
  which prohibits manufacturers and distributors from marketing adulterated or misbranded products. However, if a dietary supplement
  is represented as a treatment, prevention, or cure for a specific disease, it is considered a drug and is subject to regulation as such.

The FDA oversees the dietary supplement marketplace by inspecting manufacturing facilities, monitoring adverse event reports, and
taking action against non-compliant products. The Federal Trade Commission also plays a role in regulating advertisements for dietary supplements.

It is essential to note that while the FDA has regulations in place, it does not approve dietary supplements. As someone with diabetes,
it is crucial to be aware of the regulations surrounding dietary supplements and to consult with a healthcare professional before using
 any supplement, especially considering your health condition.

It is always necessary to contact professionals to obtain more accurate information before references.
