As a 23-year-old with diabetes, it's essential to exercise caution when considering taking supplements, especially if you're already taking medications. Dietary supplements can interact with your medications, leading to adverse events or side effects, which can range from less serious to life-threatening. These interactions can occur when you combine supplements with medications, take too much of some supplements, or use supplements with prescription or over-the-counter medications.

Some potential adverse events to watch out for include rash, fatigue, severe and persistent vomiting or diarrhea, difficulty urinating, severe joint and muscle pain, chest pain, or stroke. Additionally, symptoms like itching, loss of appetite, severe or persistent abdominal pain, blood in the urine, shortness of breath, fainting, or cognitive changes can also indicate a bad reaction.

To ensure your safety, it's crucial to consult with your healthcare professional before taking any supplements. They can help you make informed decisions and provide guidance on potential interactions with your medications. Be sure to ask questions like how long you should take the supplement, potential side effects, and any foods, medicines, or other dietary supplements you should avoid while taking the product.

It's always best to consult with a healthcare professional to obtain more accurate information and personalized advice before taking any supplements, especially if you have a pre-existing condition like diabetes.
