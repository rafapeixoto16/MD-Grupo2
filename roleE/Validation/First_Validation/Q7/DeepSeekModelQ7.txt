Vitamin C is an important nutrient that helps keep your body healthy.
Oranges are a good source of vitamin C, but other foods like red peppers and kiwis have even more.
A medium orange gives you about 70 mg of vitamin C, which is a good amount. Orange juice has a bit more, around 93 mg.
Red peppers actually have the most, with 95 mg in just half a cup.

Vitamin C is great because it helps your immune system fight off germs and keeps you from getting sick. It also helps your
body heal when you get hurt. Eating different fruits and vegetables is a great way to get enough vitamin C.

Remember, it's always a good idea to talk to a doctor or a nutritionist to learn more about what your body needs.
They can give you the best advice for staying healthy.
