Dietary supplements are products intended to enhance your diet by providing essential nutrients.
They come in various forms such as tablets, capsules, and liquids. These supplements can include vitamins, minerals,
 herbs, amino acids, and probiotics, aiming to support overall health and fill nutritional gaps. While they can be beneficial,
  they shouldn't replace a balanced diet. It's important to be aware of potential risks and consult a healthcare professional
  before use, especially if you have a condition like diabetes. Always seek personalized advice from a healthcare provider to
  ensure safe and effective use.
