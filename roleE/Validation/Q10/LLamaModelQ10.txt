 Magnesium is an essential mineral in the body, playing a crucial role in over 300 enzyme systems that regulate various
  biochemical reactions, including protein synthesis, muscle and nerve function, blood glucose control, and blood pressure
  regulation. It is also necessary for energy production, oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolysis, and contributes to the
   structural development of bone and the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and the antioxidant glutathione.

Given your age and illness, leukemia, it is essential to ensure you are getting sufficient magnesium. If you are deficient,
you can increase your magnesium intake through dietary sources, such as foods naturally rich in magnesium, or through fortified
 foods and dietary supplements. However, it is crucial to consult with your healthcare provider before taking any supplements,
  especially considering your medical condition.

The federal government's Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend meeting nutritional needs primarily through foods,
 and in some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements can be useful. For building a healthy dietary pattern, refer
 to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate.

To determine the best course of action for your specific situation, it is always best to consult with a healthcare
professional, as they can provide personalized advice and guidance. They can help you assess your magnesium levels and recommend
 the most suitable way to address any deficiencies, taking into account your overall health and medical condition.
