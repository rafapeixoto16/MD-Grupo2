Biotin is often promoted for hair, skin, and nail health, and some studies suggest it may be effective in strengthening
hair and nails. For instance, biotin supplements have been shown to increase nail thickness by 25% in patients with
brittle nails. Additionally, studies have found that biotin can result in firmer and harder fingernails in a significant
percentage of patients. However, the evidence is limited, and more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness,
especially in healthy individuals. There is no indication that biotin supplementation will change the color of the nails.

It is essential to consult with a healthcare professional before taking biotin supplements to determine the best course of
treatment and to discuss any potential risks or interactions. They can provide personalized advice and help you make informed
decisions about your health.
