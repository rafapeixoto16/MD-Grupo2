Vitamin D is essential for maintaining optimal bone health and preventing osteoporosis. It plays a crucial role in calcium
absorption, which is necessary for bone strength. However, the optimal level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) remains controversial,
and recommendations vary between societies. Additionally, calcium is important for bone health, but excessive intake can lead to hypercalcemia,
which may cause kidney stones, cardiac arrhythmias, and soft-tissue calcification.

It is always necessary to contact professionals to obtain more accurate information before references.
