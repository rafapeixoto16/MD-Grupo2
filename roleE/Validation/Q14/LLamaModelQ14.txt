Vitamin D is essential for maintaining optimal bone health and preventing osteoporosis. However, the optimal level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D remains controversial, and recommendations vary between societies.

Taking too much of certain minerals, such as calcium, can have severe health consequences, including hypercalcemia, which can cause kidney stones, cardiac arrhythmias, and soft-tissue calcification. Excessive iron deposition can also lead to oxidative stress and organ/tissue damage.

It is crucial to maintain adequate mineral levels through a balanced diet, guided supplementation, and monitoring at-risk populations to prevent disorders related to deficiencies and toxicities.

To obtain more accurate information and personalized advice on preventing osteoporosis, it is recommended to consult with a healthcare professional.
