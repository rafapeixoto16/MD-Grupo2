Prolonged use of medication can potentially lead to nutritional deficiencies, as some drugs may interfere with nutrient absorption or increase the excretion of certain vitamins and minerals. For example, medications that alter gastric acid levels can affect the absorption of nutrients, particularly in older adults, who may already experience reduced dietary intake and less efficient nutrient utilization due to aging. Additionally, long-term use of dietary supplements for weight loss or other purposes can interact with medications, increasing the risk of deficiencies or other health complications.

While the exact age at which this risk becomes more pronounced is not specified, older adults are generally more susceptible due to age-related physiological changes, such as reduced nutrient absorption and the use of multiple medications. It is important to consult healthcare professionals to assess individual risks and ensure proper management of nutritional status.
