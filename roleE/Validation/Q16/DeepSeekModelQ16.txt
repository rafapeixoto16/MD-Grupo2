Pregnant women are advised to take specific supplements to support their health and their baby's development.
The recommended supplements include folic acid, vitamin D, and iron. Folic acid is essential for preventing neural tube defects,
vitamin D supports bone health and immune function, and iron is crucial for blood production. It is important to adhere to recommended
dietary allowances and be mindful of upper limits to avoid nutrient overload. While a balanced diet is ideal, supplements can help address
potential nutritional gaps. Consulting a healthcare provider is recommended to ensure safe and effective use of these supplements.
Always seek personalized advice from a healthcare professional before starting any supplementation.
