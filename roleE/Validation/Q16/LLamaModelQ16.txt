As a pregnant woman, it is recommended that you take supplements to meet the heightened nutritional
requirements during this period of rapid growth and development. The necessary supplements for pregnant women are
folic acid and vitamin D. Folic acid is crucial during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, and vitamin D is particularly
important during winter months, unless there are other risk factors. Additionally, iron, iodine, and calcium are also
critical micronutrients during pregnancy, and their deficiency consequences and the need for supplementation should be
considered. However, it is essential to be aware of the upper limits of these supplements to avoid overload.

It is always best to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best course of supplementation for your
specific needs and to ensure that you are getting the necessary nutrients while minimizing the risk of nutrient overload.
