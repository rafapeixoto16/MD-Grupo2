 For a 22-year-old pregnant individual seeking supplements to support mental health, the safest recommendation based on
 the provided context is omega-3 fatty acids, particularly from algae sources to avoid mercury exposure. Omega-3s are beneficial
 for fetal brain development and are generally considered safe during pregnancy. However, it is crucial to consult a healthcare
  provider before starting any supplement to ensure safety and appropriateness. Other supplements like curcumin, resveratrol, and
  melatonin lack sufficient pregnancy safety data, and while probiotics and multinutrient formulations can be beneficial, they should
   be chosen carefully, preferably as prenatal vitamins. Always consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice.
