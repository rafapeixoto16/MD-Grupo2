As a 22-year-old pregnant individual, it's essential to consider supplements that can support mental health while ensuring
safety for both you and your baby. Some supplements that may have a positive impact on mental health include omega-3 fatty acids, curcumin,
and resveratrol. Omega-3 fatty acids, in particular, have been reported to have positive effects at a dosage of 2 g/day. Additionally, curcumin
at 800 mg/day and resveratrol at 600 mg/day have shown potential in reducing cognitive decline and inflammation. Other supplements like phosphatidylserine,
 multinutrient formulations, probiotics, vitamin E, and melatonin may also be beneficial, although more research is needed to confirm their efficacy and safety.

It's crucial to note that while these supplements may have potential benefits, the lack of data on optimal dosages, administration duration, and long-term
safety limits clinical guidelines. As a pregnant individual, it's vital to consult with a healthcare professional before taking any supplements to ensure
 they are safe for you and your baby.
