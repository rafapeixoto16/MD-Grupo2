Even if you have a balanced diet, you may still require supplements to meet your daily requirements of essential nutrients, such as calcium and vitamin D for strong bones. However, it is crucial to note that supplements should not take the place of a variety of foods that are important for a healthy diet.

Nevertheless, taking higher than recommended doses of supplements can cause adverse effects, and it is essential to consult with a healthcare professional before deciding to take any supplement.

Always research and talk to your healthcare professional before taking any supplement, and be aware of potential interactions with drugs or other supplements.
