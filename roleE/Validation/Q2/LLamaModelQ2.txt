The primary difference between a dietary supplement and a medicine lies in their intended use and composition. A dietary supplement is a product intended for ingestion that contains a dietary ingredient, such as vitamins, minerals, herbs, and amino acids, aimed at supplementing the diet. These products are designed to add to or enhance the diet, and they can come in various forms like tablets, capsules, and liquids. On the other hand, medicine is typically defined as a substance used to treat, cure, or prevent a disease or medical condition.

It is essential to consult with your doctor or healthcare provider before using any dietary supplement, especially considering your specific health situation. They can provide personalized advice and help you make informed decisions about your health.

For more accurate information and guidance, it is always best to consult with healthcare professionals.
