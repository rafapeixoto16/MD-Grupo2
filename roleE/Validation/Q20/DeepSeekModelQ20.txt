To determine if you need a supplement, consider your diet, lifestyle, and specific health needs. If you consistently consume a well-balanced diet, you may not require supplements. However, if you have deficiencies or follow a restrictive diet (e.g., vegan), supplements like vitamin D, iron, or iodine might be necessary. Consulting a healthcare professional is crucial, as they can assess your needs through diet evaluation or tests.

The time it takes for a supplement to start working varies depending on the nutrient, the severity of the deficiency, and individual factors. For example, iron supplements may begin to improve blood levels within a few weeks, while vitamin D might take longer to show effects. Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
