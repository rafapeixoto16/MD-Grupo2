Taking supplements and medications simultaneously can lead to various effects, particularly for a 50-year-old individual
with poor health. These interactions can range from mild to severe. For instance, St. Johnâ€™s Wort may reduce the effectiveness
 of medications for heart disease, cancer, HIV, depression, seizures, and birth control. Antioxidants like vitamins C and E could
  diminish the efficacy of chemotherapy, while Vitamin K may interfere with blood thinners such as warfarin. Additionally,
  high doses of omega-3 fatty acids (4g/day) might increase the risk of atrial fibrillation in those with cardiovascular issues.
   Common side effects include gastrointestinal discomfort, headaches, and unpleasant odors. Given the potential for adverse interactions,
   consulting healthcare professionals is crucial to ensure safe and effective treatment.
