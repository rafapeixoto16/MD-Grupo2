Taking supplements and medications at the same time can lead to adverse events, which can range from less serious to life-threatening.
These events may include rash, fatigue, severe and persistent vomiting or diarrhea, difficulty urinating, severe joint and muscle pain,
 chest pain, or stroke. Additionally, certain supplements can interact with medications, reducing their effectiveness or causing problems.
  For example, St. John's wort can reduce the effectiveness of medications prescribed for heart disease, cancer, HIV, depression, seizures,
   and birth control, while antioxidant supplements like vitamins C and E might reduce the effectiveness of some types of cancer chemotherapy.
   Furthermore, vitamin K can reduce the ability of the blood thinner warfarin to prevent blood from clotting. It is essential to be cautious when
    combining supplements and medications, especially for individuals with pre-existing health conditions, like yourself, with bad health at the age of 50.

It is crucial to consult with healthcare professionals before taking any supplements or medications to discuss possible interactions and ensure
safe use. They can provide personalized advice and help you make informed decisions about your health.
