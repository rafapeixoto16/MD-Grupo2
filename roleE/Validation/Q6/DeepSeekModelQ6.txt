Vitamins play a vital role in human health, particularly in the development and maintenance of oral health in children.
 These nutrients are broadly categorized into fat-soluble and water-soluble types, crucial for children's well-being.
 The objective of this study is to investigate the impact of vitamin deficiencies on the oral health of children, focusing
 on how these deficiencies contribute to various oral health issues and determining the relationship between specific vitamin
  shortages and oral diseases. Findings indicate that shortages in vitamins A and D lead to enamel issues and a higher susceptibility
 to dental diseases,
vitamin E assists in treating oral mucositis, and vitamin K is essential for blood clotting in dental surgeries.
