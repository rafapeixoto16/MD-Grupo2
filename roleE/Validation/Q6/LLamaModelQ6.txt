Vitamins, particularly vitamins C and D, play a crucial role in maintaining overall health, especially for individuals with
compromised health like yourself. Vitamin D, a fat-soluble vitamin, is essential for various bodily functions, including bone health
 and immune system regulation. It can be obtained through sun exposure, food, and supplements, and must undergo two hydroxylations in
 the body for activation.

Vitamins C and D, along with other vitamins, are vital for the optimal functioning of the immune system. They facilitate the production
of cytokines, the differentiation of immunological cells, and the neutralization of free radicals. Additionally, adequate amounts of vitamins,
including vitamins C and D, are required for maintaining normal cardiac and vascular function, and their deficiencies can
contribute to cardiovascular abnormalities.

In the context of cardiovascular health, deficiencies in vitamins C and D have been associated with suboptimal cardiovascular function, whereas
additional intakes have been suggested to reduce the risk of atherosclerosis, hypertension, and heart disease.

It is essential to note that while vitamins are crucial for overall health, individual needs may vary depending on factors such as age and health
status. Therefore, it is always necessary to consult with healthcare professionals to determine the best course of action and obtain more accurate
information before making any references.
