Vitamin C is an essential nutrient that can be found in various foods, particularly in fruits and vegetables.
Oranges are indeed a good source of vitamin C, with one medium orange providing about 70 milligrams of vitamin C,
which is approximately 78% of the daily recommended intake. However, it's worth noting that other foods like red peppers
 and kiwifruit are also rich in vitamin C. For example, a half cup of raw red pepper contains about 95 milligrams of vitamin C,
  while a medium kiwifruit contains about 64 milligrams.

Vitamin C plays a crucial role in maintaining good health, and its antioxidant properties may help prevent certain diseases,
such as cancer and cardiovascular disease. It's also important for immune function and can help reduce the severity of the common cold.

To get an accurate understanding of the daily recommended intake of vitamin C and its benefits, it's essential to consult with a
 healthcare professional. They can provide personalized advice and help you make informed decisions about your diet and supplements.
