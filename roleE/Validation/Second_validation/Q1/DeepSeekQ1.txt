Dietary supplements are products intended to add to or supplement the diet, and they come in various forms such as
tablets, capsules, soft gels, gel caps, powders, bars, gummies, and liquids. These supplements are ingested and can
contain a range of ingredients including vitamins, minerals, herbs, botanicals, amino acids, and live microbials, also
 known as probiotics. The primary purpose of dietary supplements is to help improve or maintain overall health, and they
 can also assist in meeting daily requirements of essential nutrients. For instance, calcium and vitamin D can help build
 strong bones, while fiber can help maintain bowel regularity. It is essential to note that dietary supplements should not
 replace a healthy and varied diet, but rather complement it. Additionally, it is crucial to be aware of the potential risks
  associated with taking dietary supplements and to use them safely.

It is always necessary to contact professionals to obtain more accurate information before references,
such as FDA 101: Dietary Supplements, Understanding Dietary Supplements, and Questions and Answers on Dietary Supplements.
