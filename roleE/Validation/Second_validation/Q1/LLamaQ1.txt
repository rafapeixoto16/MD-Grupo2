Dietary supplements are products designed to complement the diet by providing essential nutrients.
They come in various forms such as tablets, capsules, and gummies, and include ingredients like vitamins,
minerals, herbs, amino acids, and probiotics. These supplements aim to support overall health and help meet daily
 nutritional needs, such as calcium and vitamin D for bone health. However, they should not replace a balanced diet.
 While they can offer benefits, they also carry potential risks, so safe usage and professional consultation are
 recommended for personalized advice.
