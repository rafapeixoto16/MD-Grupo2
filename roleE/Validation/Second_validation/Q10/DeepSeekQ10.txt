Magnesium is an essential mineral in the body that plays a crucial role in various biochemical reactions,
 including protein synthesis, muscle and nerve function, blood glucose control, and blood pressure regulation.
 It is also necessary for energy production, oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolysis, and contributes to the
 structural development of bone and the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and the antioxidant glutathione. Additionally, magnesium
 is involved in the active transport of calcium and potassium ions across cell membranes, which is important for nerve
 impulse conduction, muscle contraction, and normal heart rhythm.

To get more magnesium if you are deficient, it is recommended to consume foods that are rich in magnesium, as dietary
needs should be met primarily through foods. Fortified foods and dietary supplements can also be useful when it is not
possible to meet needs for one or more nutrients through food alone. The federal government's Dietary Guidelines for
Americans suggest building a healthy dietary pattern, and the USDA's MyPlate can provide more information on this topic.
It is also important to note that normal serum magnesium concentrations range between 0.75 and 0.95 millimoles per liter,
 and hypomagnesemia is defined as a serum magnesium level less than 0.75 mmol/L.

It is always necessary to contact professionals to obtain more accurate information before references, magnesium.
