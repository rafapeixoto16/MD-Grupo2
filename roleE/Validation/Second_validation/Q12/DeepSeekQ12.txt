Biotin is often promoted for hair, skin, and nail health, and some studies suggest it may be
effective in strengthening hair and nails. For instance, one study found that biotin supplementation
 increased nail thickness by 25% in patients with brittle nails, and another study found that 91% of
  patients with thin and brittle fingernails experienced firmer and harder fingernails after taking biotin
   supplements. However, the evidence is limited and not all studies have found significant improvements.
    Additionally, there is no good scientific evidence to support the use of biotin for hair loss or other conditions.
     It is also worth noting that biotin supplements may interfere with some lab tests, and consumers should talk to
     their doctor before taking biotin supplements. The color of the nails may not necessarily change as a result of
      biotin supplementation, as the studies primarily focused on the thickness and hardness of the nails.

It is essential to consult with a healthcare professional before taking any supplements, including biotin, to
 determine the best course of treatment for individual needs. They can provide personalized advice and help you
 make informed decisions about your health.
