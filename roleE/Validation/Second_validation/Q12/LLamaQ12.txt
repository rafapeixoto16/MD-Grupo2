Biotin is often promoted for improving hair, skin, and nail health,
but the evidence supporting its effectiveness is limited and inconsistent. Some small studies suggest
that biotin supplementation may help strengthen brittle nails. For example, one study found that taking 2.5 mg
of biotin daily for several months increased nail thickness in some participants. Another study reported that 91% of
patients with thin and brittle fingernails experienced firmer and harder nails after biotin supplementation. However,
 these studies were not placebo-controlled, and the results were not always statistically significant. Additionally,
 there is no strong scientific evidence to support the claim that biotin improves hair health in adults, although it
 may be beneficial for children with specific hair disorders.

Regarding nail color, there is no information in the provided context suggesting that biotin supplementation changes
the color of nails. The studies primarily focus on nail thickness and strength rather than color.

In summary, while some studies indicate that biotin may improve nail strength, the evidence is not conclusive, and more
 rigorous research is needed to confirm its effectiveness. There is no evidence to suggest that biotin affects nail color.
 Always consult a healthcare professional before starting any supplementation to get personalized advice.
