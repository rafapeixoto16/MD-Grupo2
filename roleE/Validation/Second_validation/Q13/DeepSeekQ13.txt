To strengthen the immune system and help cure possible flus, various supplements can be considered.
Vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc, and multivitamins are among the most widely reported supplements used for this purpose.
Additionally, natural and herbal products such as ginger and honey have also been utilized. Other nutraceuticals
like amino acids, flavonoids, and probiotics have been studied for their role in preventing COVID-19 symptoms, which
can also be applicable to flu prevention. Furthermore, oral zinc has been shown to reduce the length and severity of
colds, while probiotics can reduce the number of episodes of acute upper respiratory tract infections. It is essential
 to note that a balanced and nutritious diet, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, proteins, and probiotics, is
 crucial for maintaining an optimal immune system. While single-nutrient supplements are not generally recommended,
  multi-nutrient supplements may be beneficial for individuals with deficiencies. It is always necessary to contact
   professionals to obtain more accurate information before references, such as consulting a healthcare provider or a
    registered dietitian, to determine the best course of supplementation for individual needs, as described in the
