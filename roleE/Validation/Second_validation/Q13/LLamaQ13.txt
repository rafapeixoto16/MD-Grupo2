Supplements that may help strengthen the immune system and potentially aid in managing
flu-like symptoms include vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc, and multivitamins. These supplements are commonly reported
 for their immune-boosting properties and are often used to prevent infections such as COVID-19. Additionally,
 natural products like ginger and honey have been utilized for their potential benefits in supporting immune function.
 Probiotics, curcumin, and other nutraceuticals have also been studied for their role in reducing symptoms of viral
 infections, such as fever and dry cough. It is important to note that while these supplements may support immune health,
  they should not replace medical treatments for flu or other infections. Consulting with healthcare professionals is
   essential to determine the best approach for individual needs.
