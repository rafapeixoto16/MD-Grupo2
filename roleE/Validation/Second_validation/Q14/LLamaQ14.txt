Vitamins play a crucial role in maintaining bone health and preventing osteoporosis.
 Key vitamins include vitamin D, calcium, and others such as vitamins A, C, E, K, and B vitamins.
  Vitamin D is essential for bone health, though optimal levels are debated. Calcium, often taken with vitamin D,
  supports bone strength. Vitamins A, C, E, K, and B vitamins also contribute to bone health by supporting various
  physiological processes.

Excessive intake of these vitamins can be harmful. For instance, too much calcium can lead to hypercalcemia,
causing kidney stones and cardiac issues. Similarly, excessive vitamin D can result in toxicity, affecting organs.
It is important to maintain balanced levels through diet and guided supplementation.

Consulting healthcare professionals is advisable to ensure appropriate supplementation and prevent potential harm.
