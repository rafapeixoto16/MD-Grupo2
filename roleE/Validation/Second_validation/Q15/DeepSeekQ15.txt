Prolonged use of medication can indeed lead to nutritional deficiencies, although the specific age at which this
 occurs is not clearly defined. The use of medications and supplements over long periods can increase the risk of
  interactions, potentially causing serious health problems. For instance, iron deficiency is a common issue, particularly
  in infants, preschool children, and adolescents, often resulting from inadequate dietary intake, increased iron requirements,
   or absorption disorders. Similarly, deficiencies in other micronutrients like vitamin B12, zinc, and vitamin D can also arise,
    potentially leading to various health issues, including anemia, impaired neurodevelopment, and skin problems. It is essential
     to note that preventing these deficiencies is crucial, and this can be achieved through supplementation and food-based
     approaches. However, the age at which prolonged medication use causes nutritional deficiencies is not explicitly stated,
      suggesting that it can occur at any age, depending on the individual's circumstances and the specific medications or
       supplements being used. It is always necessary to contact professionals to obtain more accurate information before
        references, such as consulting the articles A comprehensive investigation of biochemical status in patients with
        telogen effluvium, Main nutritional deficiencies, omega-3 fatty acids, Dietary Supplements for Weight Loss and Drug
         Interactions, and Iron Deficiency Anemia in Infancy, Childhood, and Adolescence.
