Prolonged use of medication can potentially lead to nutritional deficiencies, particularly in certain age groups.
For instance, iron deficiency is more prevalent in infants, preschool children, and adolescents due to factors such as
 inadequate dietary intake, increased iron requirements, and absorption disorders. Additionally, long-term use of dietary
  supplements for weight loss can interact with medications, increasing the risk of nutritional deficiencies and health
   complications. It is important to consult healthcare professionals to obtain more accurate information and personalized
    advice.
