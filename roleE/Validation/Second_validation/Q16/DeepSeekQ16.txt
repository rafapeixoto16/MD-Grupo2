Pregnant women should take supplements to meet their heightened nutritional requirements during this
period of rapid growth and development. The necessary supplements for pregnant women are folic acid and vitamin D.
Folic acid is crucial during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, and vitamin D supplementation is recommended, particularly
during winter months, unless there are other risk factors. It is essential for pregnant women to carefully evaluate the
 ingredients, dosages, efficacy, and safety of prenatal supplements with the guidance of their healthcare provider, as
  there are concerns regarding their regulation, dosages, and potential harm to the mother and fetus. While prenatal
   supplements can offer important benefits, including reduced risk of birth defects and improved fetal growth and development,
    it is crucial to be cautious about taking dietary supplements beyond a standard prenatal supplement. Women who are or are
    planning to become pregnant should be educated on dietary recommendations during pregnancy and lactation, ideally such that
    supplements become unnecessary. However, it remains good practice to carefully consider prenatal vitamin content before
    selection. It is always necessary to contact professionals to obtain more accurate information before references,
     such as consulting a healthcare provider, to ensure the best possible outcome for both the mother and the fetus,
      and for more information, you can refer to Evidence reviews for interventions to increase uptake of vitamin
       supplements, Evidence reviews for facilitators and barriers to increase the uptake of government advice on
