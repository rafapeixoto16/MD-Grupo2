Supplements that can help with mental health include various vitamins, minerals, botanicals,
and amino acids. For instance, vitamin D and magnesium have been discussed for their potential benefits in managing
fibromyalgia, a condition that often involves mental health aspects, through mechanisms such as anti-inflammatory effects
and modulation of neurotransmitters. Additionally, supplements like omega-3 fatty acids, melatonin, S-adenosylmethionine,
 and acetyl-L-carnitine are also considered for their potential benefits in mental health management. Plant-based supplements
 from sources like Bacopa monnieri, Curcuma longa, and Ginkgo biloba have been found to possess medicinal properties that
  can improve cognitive function and reduce oxidative stress, potentially contributing to improved mental health.
  Furthermore, probiotics, which are live microbials, have been shown to have a positive impact on mental health by
   influencing the gut-brain interaction. It is essential to note that while these supplements show potential, the
    efficacy and safety of nutritional supplements in mental health management can vary, and more research is needed
    to establish comprehensive guidelines. Therefore, it is crucial to consult with healthcare professionals before
    adding any supplements to your regimen to ensure you receive the most accurate and personalized advice for your
    specific needs.
