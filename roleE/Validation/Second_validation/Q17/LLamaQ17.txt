Supplements that may support mental health include omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, magnesium, B vitamins, probiotics,
 melatonin, curcumin, Bacopa monnieri, Ginkgo biloba, and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM-e). These supplements have shown
 potential in addressing symptoms of anxiety, depression, and cognitive decline through various mechanisms such as
  anti-inflammatory effects, neurotransmitter modulation, and mitochondrial function improvement. However, it is important
   to note that while these supplements show promise, further research is needed to establish their efficacy and safety fully.
    Consulting with a healthcare professional is crucial before starting any supplementation regimen to ensure personalized
     and appropriate use.
