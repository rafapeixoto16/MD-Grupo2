The difference between a dietary supplement and a medicine lies in their intended use and regulatory oversight.
Dietary supplements are products intended to supplement the diet, containing ingredients such as vitamins, minerals,
herbs, and amino acids, and are not intended to treat, diagnose, mitigate, prevent, or cure diseases. On the other hand,
 medicines are products that must be approved by the FDA before they can be sold or marketed, and are intended to treat,
  diagnose, or prevent diseases. The FDA regulates both supplements and medicines, but the regulations for dietary supplements
   are different from those for prescription or over-the-counter medicines, with supplement companies being responsible for
    ensuring the safety and truthfulness of their products. It is essential to understand the distinction between dietary
    supplements and medicines to use them safely and effectively. It is always necessary to contact professionals to obtain
    more accurate information before references, such as consulting with a healthcare provider or registered dietitian.
