Dietary supplements and medicines differ primarily in their purpose, regulation, and function.
 Dietary supplements are intended to enhance the diet by providing vitamins, minerals, herbs, or other dietary
 ingredients, but they are not designed to treat, diagnose, cure, or prevent diseases. They are regulated by the
  FDA but do not require pre-market approval, and their manufacturers are responsible for ensuring safety and truthful
  labeling. In contrast, medicines are FDA-approved products specifically created to diagnose, treat, or prevent diseases,
  undergoing stricter regulatory scrutiny. While supplements support overall health, medicines are targeted for therapeutic
   or preventive purposes. Always consult healthcare professionals for personalized advice.
