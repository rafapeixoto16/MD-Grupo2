Before starting to take supplements, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional, such as
 a doctor, nurse, registered dietician, or pharmacist. They can help determine if a supplement is appropriate
  for you by evaluating potential benefits and risks, including interactions with medications, effects on lab tests,
  or risks during surgery. Additionally, overconsumption of supplements can lead to harmful effects, as higher doses
   are not necessarily better for health. A balanced diet should always be the cornerstone of health, and supplements
   should not replace it.

When buying supplements online, there are risks related to safety and quality. Some products may be contaminated or
contain concentrations of bioactive agents that are outside safe limits. Additionally, the regulation of supplements
varies, and online products may not always meet established safety standards. It is important to choose trusted sources
and verify the products you purchase. Botanicals and other substances in supplements, especially those without a history
of safe use, may pose additional risks.

Always consult a healthcare professional before starting any supplement regimen to ensure it is safe and appropriate for
your health needs. For more information, you can refer to resources like the FDA's guidance on dietary supplements and
EFSA's information on food supplements.
