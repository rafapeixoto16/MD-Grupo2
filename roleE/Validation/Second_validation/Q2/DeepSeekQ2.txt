The primary difference between a dietary supplement and a medicine lies in their intended use and the regulations that govern them. Dietary supplements are products intended to supplement the diet, containing ingredients such as vitamins, minerals, herbs, and amino acids, and are not intended to treat, diagnose, mitigate, prevent, or cure diseases. On the other hand, medicines are products that are specifically designed to treat, diagnose, or prevent diseases. The FDA regulates both supplements and medicines, but the regulations for dietary supplements are different from those for prescription or over-the-counter medicines. Unlike medicines, which must be approved by the FDA before they can be sold or marketed, dietary supplements do not require FDA approval. Instead, supplement companies are responsible for ensuring that their products are safe and that the label claims are truthful and not misleading.

It is essential to understand that if a product is intended to treat, diagnose, cure, or prevent diseases, it is considered a drug, even if it is labeled as a dietary supplement. The distinction between dietary supplements and medicines is crucial, as it affects how these products are regulated, marketed, and used by consumers. While dietary supplements can be beneficial to health, they can also involve health risks, and it is crucial to know the facts before deciding whether to take a supplement. 

It is always necessary to contact professionals to obtain more accurate information before references.
