Dietary supplements and medicines differ primarily in their purpose, regulation, and function. Dietary supplements are intended to enhance the diet by providing vitamins, minerals, herbs, or other dietary ingredients. They do not require FDA approval, and their labels must be truthful and safe, with the responsibility on the manufacturer. Supplements are not meant to treat, diagnose, or cure diseases. In contrast, medicines are designed to treat, diagnose, prevent, or cure diseases, necessitating FDA approval before sale. This distinction underscores their different roles in health management. Always consult healthcare professionals for personalized advice.
