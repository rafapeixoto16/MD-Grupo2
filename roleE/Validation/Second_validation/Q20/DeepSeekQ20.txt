To determine if you need a supplement, it is essential to consider your diet and whether you are consistently
consuming a well-balanced diet. Certain micronutrients, such as vitamin D, iron, vitamin A, zinc, folate, and iodine,
 are commonly required in supplement form. However, it is crucial to note that taking higher than recommended doses can
 cause adverse effects. If you are unsure, it is best to consult with a healthcare professional, such as your doctor,
 nurse, registered dietician, or pharmacist, to discuss the benefits and risks of dietary supplements.

The length of time it takes for a supplement to start working can vary depending on the type of supplement and individual
factors. It is essential to follow the recommended dosage and consult with a healthcare professional if you notice any
 adverse effects. They can help you determine the proper dose to take, how, when, and for how long you should take it.
 Additionally, it is crucial to be aware of potential interactions with medications, lab tests, or surgery. By consulting
 with a healthcare professional, you can make informed decisions about dietary supplements and ensure you are taking the
  right steps to maintain a healthy diet.
