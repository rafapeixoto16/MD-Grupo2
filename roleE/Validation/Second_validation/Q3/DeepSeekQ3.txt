Supplements are not regulated like medications, as they are considered products intended to supplement the diet and
 are not intended to treat, diagnose, mitigate, prevent, or cure diseases. The FDA oversees both supplements and medicines,
  but the regulations for dietary supplements are different from those for prescription or over-the-counter medicines.
   Unlike medicines, supplements do not require FDA approval before they can be sold or marketed. Instead, supplement
    companies are responsible for having evidence that their products are safe and that the label claims are truthful
     and not misleading. The FDA regulates dietary supplements under a different set of regulations than those covering
      conventional foods and drug products, and manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplements are prohibited
      from marketing products that are adulterated or misbranded. It is essential to note that while supplements are not
       regulated like medications, they can still have significant effects on the body, and it is crucial to consult with
       a healthcare professional before taking any supplement to ensure safe and effective use. Therefore, it is always
       necessary to contact professionals to obtain more accurate information before references, Dietary Supplements: What
