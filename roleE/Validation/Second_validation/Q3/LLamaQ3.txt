Supplements are not regulated in the same way as medications. While both are overseen by the FDA, the regulatory
frameworks differ significantly. Medications must undergo rigorous testing and approval processes before they can be
 marketed, ensuring their safety and efficacy. In contrast, dietary supplements do not require pre-market approval.
  Instead, the responsibility lies with the manufacturers to ensure their products are safe and that their labeling is
  truthful and not misleading. The FDA regulates supplements under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994,
   which classifies them differently from conventional foods and drugs. This means that while the FDA monitors safety and
   labeling, supplements are treated more like foods than medications. It is important to note that if a product claims to
    treat, diagnose, cure, or prevent a disease, it is considered a drug and subject to stricter regulation. Always consult
    with healthcare professionals before using any supplements to ensure they are appropriate for your needs.
