 can have strong effects in the body and can interact with medications, interfere with lab tests, or have dangerous effects d
 uring surgery. Additionally, some supplements can involve health risks, especially if taken with or instead of medications.
 It is essential to talk with a healthcare professional, such as your doctor, nurse, registered dietician, or pharmacist,
  about the benefits and risks of dietary supplements before taking them. They can help you decide what supplement, if any,
   is right for you and ensure that it will not interact with your medications or worsen your health condition.

It is crucial to be cautious when considering dietary supplements and to do your research before taking them.
 You should keep a complete record of any dietary supplements and medicines you take, including the name, dose,
 frequency, and reason for use, and share this record with your healthcare providers to discuss what's best for your
  overall health. It is also important to consult your healthcare provider before taking dietary supplements to treat a
  health condition or in combination with prescribed medicines. By being an informed consumer and talking to your
  healthcare professional, you can make safe and informed decisions about dietary supplements.
