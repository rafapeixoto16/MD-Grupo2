It is important to exercise caution when considering taking supplements, especially if you are already taking medications
or have a health condition like diabetes. Dietary supplements can interact with medications, interfere with lab tests, or
 have adverse effects, particularly during surgery. These interactions can range from mild to life-threatening and may
 include symptoms such as rash, fatigue, severe vomiting or diarrhea, difficulty urinating, joint and muscle pain, chest pain, or stroke.

Before taking any dietary supplement, it is crucial to consult with a healthcare professional, such as your doctor, nurse, pharmacist, or registered dietitian. They can help you evaluate the potential benefits and risks, ensure safe use, and prevent harmful interactions with your medications. Additionally, keep a complete record of all supplements and medications you take, including the dose, frequency, and reason for use, to share with your healthcare providers.

Always remember that dietary supplements should not replace prescribed medications or a balanced diet. If you experience any adverse reactions, seek medical attention promptly. For personalized advice, consult your healthcare provider.
