Taking supplements and medications at the same time can have adverse effects on the body.
These effects can range from less serious to life-threatening and may include rash, fatigue, severe and persistent
vomiting or diarrhea, difficulty urinating, severe joint and muscle pain, chest pain, or stroke. Certain supplements
can interact with medications in ways that might cause problems, such as reducing the effectiveness of prescribed medicines
or increasing the risk of bleeding. For example, Vitamin K can reduce the ability of the blood thinner warfarin to prevent
 blood from clotting, while St. Johnâ€™s wort can speed the breakdown of many medicines and reduce their effectiveness. It is
 essential to
 be cautious when combining supplements and medications, especially for individuals with pre-existing conditions like diabetes.

It is crucial to consult with a healthcare professional before taking any supplements, especially if you are already taking
medications. They can help you decide what supplement, if any, is right for you and ensure that you are not putting yourself at
 risk of adverse events. If you experience any adverse events while taking a dietary supplement, it is vital to immediately stop
  using the supplement, seek medical care or advice, and report the adverse event to the FDA.

In your case, as a 23-year-old with diabetes, it is essential to be mindful of the potential interactions between supplements
 and your medications. Always consult with your healthcare professional before adding any new supplements to your regimen.
  They can help you navigate the potential risks and benefits and ensure that you are making informed decisions about your health.
