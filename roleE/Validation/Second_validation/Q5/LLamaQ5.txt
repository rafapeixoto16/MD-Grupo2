Taking supplements and medications at the same time can lead to interactions
that may cause problems. These interactions can reduce the effectiveness of your medications or increase the
risk of side effects. For example, St. Johnâ€™s Wort can reduce the effectiveness of antidepressants,
 birth control pills, and heart medications. Vitamin K can interfere with blood thinners like warfarin,
 making them less effective. Additionally, some supplements, such as antioxidants, might reduce the effectiveness of chemotherapy.

Other potential risks include an increased risk of bleeding
or changes in response to anesthesia if taken before surgery.
 It is important to note that these interactions can vary depending on the specific supplement and
 medication being used. If you have diabetes, it is crucial to discuss your supplement use with your
  healthcare provider, as some supplements may interact with diabetes medications or affect blood sugar control.

If you experience any adverse effects, such as rash, fatigue, severe vomiting,
or chest pain, stop taking the supplement and seek medical advice immediately.
Always consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement,
 especially if you are taking prescription or over-the-counter medications.
