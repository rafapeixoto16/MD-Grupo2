Vitamin C is an essential nutrient that can be found in various foods, particularly in fruits and vegetables.
 Oranges are indeed a good source of vitamin C, with one medium orange providing 70 milligrams of vitamin C,
  which is 78% of the daily value. Orange juice is also a good source, with Â¾ cup providing 93 milligrams of vitamin C

  , which is 103% of the daily value. Other foods that are rich in vitamin C include red peppers, grapefruit juice, and
   kiwifruit. Vitamin C plays a crucial role in immune function and as an antioxidant, and it has been promoted as a means
   to help prevent and/or treat numerous health conditions, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, age-related macular
    degeneration, and the common cold.

The role of vitamin C in health and obesity is also significant, as it acts as a small molecule antioxidant and a co-factor
 for numerous transition metal-dependent enzymes involved in healthy weight and energy metabolism. However, vitamin C
  deficiency can result from an inadequate intake of vitamin C-containing foods, and it is mainly obtained from the
   dietary intake of fresh fruit and vegetables. There is great variability between different nutritional guidelines
    in the recommended daily allowance of vitamin C. Additionally, vitamin C has been shown to have anti-tumor ability
     and can target tumor cells in multiple targets, making it a potential application in cancer therapy.

It is always necessary to contact professionals to obtain more accurate information before references, and further
research is needed to fully understand the benefits and risks of vitamin C. References include vitamin c, Molecular
