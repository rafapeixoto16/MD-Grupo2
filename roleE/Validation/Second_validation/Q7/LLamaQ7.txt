Vitamin C is an essential nutrient that plays a crucial role in various bodily functions,
 including immune support and antioxidant activity. Oranges are indeed a well-known source of vitamin C
 , but the amount can vary depending on the serving size and type of orange product. For example, one
 medium orange provides about 70 mg of vitamin C, which is 78% of the daily value (DV), while Â¾ cup of
 orange juice contains 93 mg, representing 103% of the DV. However, other foods like red peppers and
 kiwifruit can offer even higher amounts of vitamin C per serving.

Vitamin C is widely found in fresh fruits and vegetables, and it cannot be produced by the human body,
making dietary intake essential. It serves as a co-factor for enzymes involved in energy metabolism and
weight management. Additionally, vitamin C has been associated with reduced risks of chronic diseases, such as
cancer and cardiovascular conditions, due to its antioxidant properties and immune-boosting effects. High doses
 of vitamin C have also been studied for their potential anti-tumor properties and applications in cancer treatment.

While oranges are a good source of vitamin C, it is important to maintain a balanced diet that includes a variety
 of fruits and vegetables to ensure adequate intake of this vitamin. If you have specific concerns about your vitamin
 C intake or health, it is always best to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
