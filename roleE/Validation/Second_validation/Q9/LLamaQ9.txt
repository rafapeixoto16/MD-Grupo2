Based on the provided context, the best supplements to take when going to the gym depend on your specific goals,
 such as muscle gain, performance improvement, or overall health. Protein is the most widely used supplement among gym-goers,
 particularly for muscle hypertrophy and recovery. Creatine is also popular, especially among men and younger individuals,
  as it supports performance and muscle gain. Multivitamins are another common choice, particularly for older individuals
   focusing on well-being.

For recovery, supplementing with protein and carbohydrates immediately after exercise, especially after intense workouts,
 can help alleviate fatigue, support muscle recovery, and replenish glycogen stores. Additionally, pre-workout supplements
  may be beneficial for improving performance and cardiovascular health, though their effects can vary depending on their
   ingredients.

It is important to note that individual needs may differ, and the effectiveness of these supplements can depend on factors
 such as age, gender, and specific fitness goals. Always consult with a healthcare professional or nutritionist to determine
 the best supplements for your personal needs.
